shruti statements which support reconciliation include: " सर्वे वेदाः/ सर्वे घोषाः एकैव व्याहृतिः " , "नामानि सर्वाणि यमाविशन्ति "

The way to correctly derive valid knowledge out of the sacred books is to :

- apply proper mImAMsA analysis encompassing all valid texts (thereby applying a sort of averaging),
- One doesn't use isolated quotes to make cases about what a text does or does not stand for - that is considered childish and stupid within hindu tradition. Instead one needs to consider and reconcile a whole mass of contradictory statements within all "prAmANika" texts -- this is the main purpose of a branch of analysis called miimaamsa . That is exactly what old commentators claimed to have done, and that is what modern interpreters and critics must do if they are honest. For example see this series of ongoing classes on rAmAnuja-s commentary on bhagavadgItA - shrIbhAShyam [http://ramanuja.org/sri/SribhashyaClass/Topics](http://ramanuja.org/sri/SribhashyaClass/Topics) \- the instructor went on and on with preliminaries for well over 10 hours before finally deciding to get to the central text and bring up background/ context as required.

### Examples
madhva in Rigbhashya reportedly relies on the एकवाक्यता of the veda-s to show  that all of the statements in veda-s (including Indra killing Vrtra, or a description of river or any other geographical or physical matters) are descriptions of hari
- Later thinkers like aravinda-ghoSha and dayAnanda sarasvatI did something similar.
