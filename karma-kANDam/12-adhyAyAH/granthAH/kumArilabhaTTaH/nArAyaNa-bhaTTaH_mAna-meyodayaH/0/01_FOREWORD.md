FOREWORD 

BY 

MAHĀMAHOP ÃDHYÄYA VIDYĀVĀCASPATI DARS'ANAKALÁNIDHI PROFESSOR S. KUPPUSWAMI SASTRI, M.A., I.E.S. 

Professor of Sanskrit and Comparative Philology, Presidency College, Madras. 


IT is a source of great pleasure to me to write a foreword to this publication, in compliance with the request of its editors-Dr. C. Kunhan Raja, M.A., D.Phil., who happens to be my present friend and colleague and former pupil, and Mr. S. S. Suryanarayana Sastri, Head of the Department of Philosophy in the University of Madras. 

This is a revised edition of the Sanskrit Philosophical treatise called MÄNAMEYODAYA, which was first published in 1912 as No. 19 of the Trivandrum Sanskrit Series. Dr. C. Kunhan Raja and Mr. Suryanarayana Sastri are responsible for this revised edition and include in it the Sanskrit text and their English translation. The Sanskrit text given in this edition is far more reliable and accurate than the text given in the first edition. In bringing out the present revised edition, the editors have used an additional manuscript which was not used in the first edition and which is deposited in the Government Oriental Manuscripts Library, Madras, (D.C.S. No. 15297). A comparison of this [[vi]] edition with the first edition will disclose noteworthy improvements, variations and additions. In this connection, section 13, page 6 and section 147, pages 228 and 229 in the present revised edition may be compared with the corresponding portions in the first edition. The English translation is faithful and accurate and brings the contents of this important philosophical text within the easy reach of the students of modern Universities, who are mostly using the English language as their medium of thought and expression in their academical and public life. The detailed table of contents and the comparative list of doctrinal differences prefixed to this edition greatly enhance its value. 

The Sanskrit text published in this volume is a valuable philosophical manual of the Bhāṭṭa school; and as its significant title MÄNAMEYODAYA shows, it represents an authoritative and informative elucidation (udaya) of the recognised means of valid knowledge (māna) and the categories (meya) constituting the objective content of valid knowledge, in accordance with Kumärila Bhatta's school known as the Bhāṭṭa school. The first part of this book (mānapariccheda) deals with the pramāņas and was written by the famous Nārāyaṇa Bhațţa of Malabar, who flourished in the latter half of the 16th century. The second part (meyapariccheda) was produced by a later scholar, who was also called Nārāyaṇa Pandita. Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa, the author of the first half, was one of the greatest scholar-poets of Kerala in the 16th century. He is the famous author of the Nārāyaṇiya and Prakriyāṣarvasva. His versatility,

profound scholarship, saintly character and great poetic talents are justly praised in the following terms at the beginning of the Bhaktapriya, a commentary on the Narayaniya : 

समधिगतनिखिल निगमार्थसतत्त्वः, शाब्दपरब्रह्मपारावारपारीणः, परमभागवतः सकलसहृदयमहितयशाः श्रीनारायणकविः ॥ 

The second part of this work is an appropriate complement to the first part and rises to an almost equally high level. 

Within a brief compass, in a style which is at once lucid and terse, this work gives an able and well-grounded exposition of the leading tenets of the philosophical side of the Bhaṭṭa school, and adds comparative and critical remarks, where required, with particular reference to the corresponding tenets of other systems of Indian philosophical thought-chiefly the Präbhākara, Nyaya, Advaita and Bauddha systems. I am sure that, in the form in which the text is presented in this edition and with the reliable English translation which is given here, this work will be of great value as an efficient aid to the study of Indian philosophy in general, and more especially to the appreciation of the distinctive features of the Bhaṭṭa phase of realism in Indian philosophical thought. I congratulate Dr. C. Kunhan Raja and Mr. S. S. Suryanarayana Sastri on this substantial piece of work in the sphere of Indian Philosophy.
