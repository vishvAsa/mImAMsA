<p>If here there is anything of the doctrine of Kumărila whose meaning is difficult or whose meaning is conflicting, all such things have to be examined by men of cultured mind. And may all my performances in the form of prattling turn out to be an adoration of Hari whose form of absolute bliss is extolled in the</p>

<p>Oh, the hosts of evil karmas, keep away from this creeper-like body of mine. I say this on account of the friendship that has grown out of familiarity; do not entertain any doubts to the contrary.

<p>NOTES</p>
<p>I. MEANS OF VALID KNOWLEDGE</p>
<p>(i) INTRODUCTION</p>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;Divided into means of knowledge and objects of knowledge&rdquo; (mānameyavibhāgena): this suggests the title of the work, MANAMEYODAYA. The actual title is given</li>
</ol>
<p>in the Introduction to the second part.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>&ldquo;Restatement (anuvada)&rdquo;: cognition is divided into recollection and experience. When there are two identical experiences, one coming after and repeating the other, the second is called anuvada, the object being already known in the earlier cognition. Mimamsakas do not bring anuvada within the sphere of validity and invalidity.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Manifestedness is established in II. iv. 35-41 and time is established as perceptible in II. ii. 81–85.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>The translation of the last three lines in this paragraph was omitted in printing, through an oversight. It is given here: &ldquo;Experience is valid knowledge. And cognition other than recollection is experience. So say the followers of Prabhakara., That also is too wide, since delusion etc. have been established and since they too are other than recollection.”</li>
</ol>

<ol start="15">
<li>For a tabular representation of the various pramāņas accepted by the different systems, see the comparative tables.</li>
</ol>
<p>(ii) PERCEPTION</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sense-contact&rdquo;: according to the difference in the intention of the speaker, either the sense or the contact may be regarded as the instrument (see para 23 below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sound, according to the Mimamsakas, is a substance, not a quality; see II. ii. 131.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>**</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Mind is all-pervasive&quot;: established in II. ii.</li>
</ol>
<p>124-128.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>(a) &ldquo;Function by reaching to the object&rdquo;: the senses of taste, smell and touch can function only when they reach to the object, not from a distance. But there is a dispute as to whether the senses of sight and hearing can function away from the object. On the analogy of the other three senses, these two are also made out to</li>
</ol>
<p>function only by reaching to the object.</p>
<p>(b) &ldquo;An extended field, which is made out as the nature of light&rdquo;: in seeing an object, rays of light are said to go forth from the eyes and reach the object. The sense of sight being a modification of fire, the rays of light are of its very nature.</p>
<p>(c) &ldquo;Unseen potentiality&rdquo;: every act, though perishing momentarily, is assumed to leave behind an unseen potentiality (apurva or adrsta), the sum of which determines the experiences of another life. Such a potentiality is assumed to account for the diversity of experiences, pleasant or otherwise, which cannot be explained by the</p>
<p>NOTES</p>
<p>[[313]]</p>
<p>visible conditions of the experience. The unseen potentiality is a co-operating factor in every experience.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>
<p>Conjunction between two all-pervasive substances: established in II. ii. 128. Concepts like simultaneity have time as object: established in II. ii. 85.</p>

<p>(a) &ldquo;Opponents&rdquo;: here refers to the Logicians.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(b) &ldquo;Identity as relation&rdquo;: established in 11.</p>
<p>vi. 15.</p>
<ol start="17">
<li>(a) One person approaches a lamp, mistaking its glow for a gem; he is evidently wrong. Another approaches a gem, thinking its glow to be the gem itself; he too is wrong, in so far as he mistakes the glow for what glows. Although both are wrong, one succeeds in getting the gem, not the other.</li>
</ol>

<p>Guru&quot;: this is a term commonly applied to Prabhakara.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;&ldquo;Instrumentality (karanatva)&rdquo;: this is used in a technical sense. A karana is that which is looked upon as of greatest service in the production of the effect. Thus, though the sense-organ and its contact are both instrumental in the production of the cognition, one or the other is pre-eminently the karaņa, according to the manner in which the production of the cognition is looked upon. Cognition is karaņa in respect of manifestedness (see i, 11 above).</p>

<p>(iii) INFERENCE</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is not proximate (asannikṛṣṭa)&rdquo;: for the meaning and purpose of this term, see para 31 below.</p>
<p>&quot; 6. This inference&quot;: &ldquo;Sound is non-eternal, because it can be produced,&rdquo; given in para 5 above. This inference does not represent the Mīmāṁsaka view, according to which sound is eternal.</p>
<p>**</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Maitri&rsquo;s seven children are dark, and she is expecting an eighth child. One may infer thus: The eighth child will be dark because it is Maitri&rsquo;s child.&quot; Now, if the dark complexion be due to the fact that Maitri had been eating greens,&quot; not because they are her children, then eating greens is an extraneous adjunct. Suppose that during the expectancy of the eighth child she had not been eating greens and the child is not dark, then it is decided that eating greens is the extraneous adjunct for the dark complexion. But until the child is born, one can only suspect such an extraneous adjunct.</li>
</ol>
<p>[[14]]</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>&lsquo;Doubting kitchenness etc. to be&hellip; because no inconstancy is seen&quot;: as between fire and smoke. If really kitchenness were an extraneous adjunct, where there is no kitchenness the pervasion of smoke by fire should be inconstant, i.e., absent. As a matter of fact, however, there is no such inconstancy; therefore kitchenness is not an extraneous adjunct. Similarly for houseness etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>[[64]]</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>In the case of Maitri&rsquo;s son : see para 8 above. 15. Counter-argument (tarka)&quot;: tarka is more familiar to students of Western Logic as reductio ad absurdum. It consists in establishing the untenability of the opposite of what is desired to be established.</li>
</ol>
<p>NOTES</p>
<p>[[315]]</p>
<ol start="17">
<li>(a) Self-dependence, reciprocal dependence etc. are not enumerated separately, though they are among the possible defects that may be urged against an argument; for, they are not in essence different from tarka, in that they involve the contingency of what is not desired.</li>
</ol>
<p>in</p>
<p>(b) The nature of occasioning defects parsimony and prolixity: prolixity can occasion nothing but a defect, and that being so, the defect is occasioned directly. Parsimony, however, being a merit, occasions defect indirectly, through establishing the merit of one&rsquo;s own position as contrasted with the adversary&rsquo;s, wherein the defect is occasioned.</p>
<ol start="23">
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Doubts about invisible extraneous adjuncts&rdquo;: the Materialists do not accept inference at all. They contend that there can be no validity in an inference in that there may be extraneous adjuncts that we cannot see, and as such cannot remove; hence they vitiate inference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(a) &ldquo;Prescription of study&rdquo;: there is the statement in the Veda, One shall study one&rsquo;s own Veda &ldquo;. There the question arises, Does this prescribe the study of the mere recitation of the Veda for the sake of svarga or does this prescribe the study of the meaning of the Veda too?&rdquo; Learning the meaning is a visible result of the prescription and svarga is an invisible result. When a visible result is possible, an invisible result is not to be assumed. Therefore the prescription is taken to be for the study of the meaning of the Veda.</p>

<p>ceptor&quot; here there are two parts, namely, (1) the twiceborn shall teach the Vedas&rsquo; to his disciple, and (2) the twice-born is called the preceptor. Now which is important</p>

<p>(c) “One shall bring near the smeared stones the question arises as to what they are to be smeared with, ghee or oil or some other substance. Since the sentence, &ldquo;Ghee, verily, is fire&rdquo; follows on the injunction, and since this is a eulogistic passage which would be purposeless unless related to the foregoing injunction, it is understood that the smearing is to be with ghee.</p>
<ol start="26">
<li>
<p>&ldquo;If Veda is dependent &hellip; is not established because God is dependent on the Veda, as the source of the knowledge about him. And thus reciprocal dependence would be involved. This seems to be final, but is not really so. For, the alleged reciprocal dependence is illusory. The Veda is dependent on God for its being, while God is dependent on the Veda for the knowledge of him. The two dependences are not on a par. The Naiyayikas hold that the Veda depends on God for its validity, and this is one of the arguments of the Naiyayikas for establishing God rationally. The Sankhya and the Mimaṁsä systems do not accept this position; they do not bring in God within a rational interpretation of the universe and its phenomena. From this it is sometimes argued that there is no God according to the Sankhya and the Mimāṁsā systems. But really, the denial of God in these systems is only an aropavada (statement of what is superimposed), not a basic doctrine of the systems.</p>

<p>(a) Krttikā is a constellation and Rohini is the next. When Kṛttikā has arisen, then there is the universal connection (vyäpti) with the approach of Robiņi.</p>
<p>Here,</p>
<p>the approach of Rohini is neither identical with nor produced from the rise of Kṛttika. Yet there is vyāpti.NOTES</p>

<p>Non-existence without (avinābhāva)&rdquo;: i.e.,</p>
<p>inseparability from another.</p>
<ol start="31">
<li>There cannot be an inference about what is definitely known to be either of the particular nature desired to be established (according to Mimaṁsa system) or of the opposite nature. In the latter case, the inference</li>
</ol>
<p>though made, would suffer from the fallacy of conflict with other knowledge. In the former case there would be (for the Mimāṁsakas) no inference at all, because, know-</p>
<p>ledge, if it is to be valid, must be of what is not already known. That which avoids both these possibilities is said to be &ldquo;non-proximate &ldquo;.</p>
<ol start="36">
<li>
<p>In the way stated before: see i, 11 above.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>&lsquo;Similarly all inferences that follow quickly</p>
<p>as sublating&rdquo;: when there are two possible inferences, of which one can be effected more easily than the other, it is the former that arises and it does not allow the latter to come up. For example of this see II. ii. 69.</p>
<ol start="57">
<li>&ldquo;Here, since there is an extraneous adjunct&rdquo;: see para 2 above.</li>

<li>
<p>This is the view of the Logicians. Each word has a definite meaning. But the purpose of a word is to serve as part of a sentence and it has no independent value apart from a sentence. A sentence conveys a unitary sense, in which one element is the important one and all other parts are qualifications of this important part. Now, a word means merely the thing, and in a sentence there are signified not merely the things, but also the relations between the things. What is it that conveys this relation? Is it the words themselves or is it the things that are remembered by the words? The words have finished their function by conveying the sense of the isolated things; and between the words and the conveying of the relation, there intervenes the conveying of the isolated meanings. Therefore the order is like this; the words convey the isolated meanings and the isolated meanings (whose final purport is to convey a unitary qualified sense) convey the relation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(a) &ldquo;Secondary implication (lakṣaṇā)&rdquo;: this is the sense of a word other than the expressed sense. The latter may or may not form part of the former. Thus, in The white runs,&rdquo; the meaning of &ldquo;the white&rdquo; is, by secondary implication, &ldquo;the white horse&rdquo;; and in the village on the Ganges,&rdquo; the word Ganges secondarily implies the bank and not the river (which is the expressed sense).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(b) The Siddhanta view of how the meaning of a sentence (i.e., the relation of the things) is conveyed is thus. True, it is the sense of the words that conveys the sentence-meaning, but this is by secondary implication. The isolated senses of the words in themselves are unintelligible, and so we resort to secondary implication.</p>

<li>This is the view of Prabhākara. Both the isolated sense of the word and the relation are expressed by</li>
</ol>
<p>the word. If the sense of the word is taken to convey the relation among the word-senses, there is this difficulty. One hears the sentence, &ldquo;Tie up the cow and also sees a horse that has to be tied up too. If it is the object cow that conveys the relation with the act of tying up, the object horse too is known at that time, and why cannot the relation be conveyed by the horse too? To avoid this difficulty, Prabhakara holds that the relation is conveyed by the word itself and not by the word-sense.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>
<p>This is discarded because there is the fault of prolixity in it. According to the Siddhanta, there is no need to assume in the words the capacity to convey the relation. Further it is more in accordance with parsimony to assume this capacity of conveying the relation in the word-sense than in the word. The last sentence in this paragraph is a reply to the theory stated in the second. of the two stanzas in para 5.</p>

<p>presumption; i.e., according to them, all cases of presumption should be brought under inference. If all cases where there is a conflict between two valid cognitions be considered as cases of presumption, then, the Logicians say, all cases of inference would have to be brought under presumption. 5. &ldquo;There does not result its non-validity, there being scope&rdquo;: if a man is alive, then it is expected that he will be at home. Therefore his not being at home conflicts with his being alive. Yet the man can be alive and at the same time be out of his house; hence there is scope for his not being at home, though he is alive. Thus, it is not necessary that the man&rsquo;s not being at home should be invalid because of being in conflict with his being alive.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>(a) &ldquo;If he is related merely to space this person too would become space&rdquo;: what is related to space in general is but a particular space or locality. Individual existents are related to those particular localities, not to space in general. If they were related to space in general, then they would be identical with space itself; because it is only individuals coming under a generality that are directly related to that generality, and individuals other than such individuals are related to that generality only indirectly, i.e., through those individuals. Thus Devadatta is related only to a particular space, either in his house or outside. If when he is known to be alive, he is known to be related directly to space in general, he would be known but as a specification thereof, i.e., as a particular space: See iii. 33 above: &ldquo;On account of the relation</li>

<p>it is known that a man is alive it is expected that he will be at home; and the man is not seen at home. This is a stage of conflict between two valid cognitions. On account of this conflict, one begins to think further and assumes that he must be outside.</p>

<li>This is objected to by the Siddhantin. Simply because something is seen in the model, it is not to be imported into the modelled too; it is done only when such an importation has a purpose.

It may be argued that the object &ldquo;sun&rdquo; must be related to the senses of the other words in</li>

<p>are going to extend to the understanding of non-existence a feature that is observed in perception etc., then we propose to extend to all cases of the understanding of non-existence a feature that is seen in some cases of the understanding of non-existence; i,e., the understanding by inference of the non-existence of a thing; and the feature is that its karaņa is not a sense-organ. For example, when we infer the non-existence of smoke from the nonexistence of fire, the karana is the knowledge of the non-existence of fire, and this is not a sense-organ. From this why should we not generalise that in the understanding of non-existence, the karana is not a sense-organ? Then, non-existence would cease to be perceptible.</p>

God&rsquo;s desire and volition are, according to the Logicians, common causes of all events. How can they be the causes of events that are of a temporary nature ? God&rsquo;s desire is eternal; so is his volition. The causes for the production and destruction of things in this world approach one another occasionally, and things are produced or destroyed. If the desire and volition of God (both eternal) be causes for such approach, how can such approach be only occasional, and not constant? God&rsquo;s desire and volition cannot be other than eternal. The usual causes for desire and volition are aversion etc. In the case of God there can be no aversion. So either He has no desire and volition, or, if He has, they must be eternal, not produced like our desire and volition, there being no cause like aversion in His case.</p>

<p>(b) According to Prabhakara, in every cognition there appear three elements, namely, the cogniser, the object (that is cognised) and the form of the cognition itself. The element of</p>
<p>of the cogniser that appears in every cognition, is the entity called the soul. It is necessary to assume that in every cognition there is the appearance of the element of the cogniser too; otherwise, if the cognition stood alone, what is there to differentiate the cognition of one from that of another? What marks out the one from the other is the element of the cogniser that appears in the cognition. The Siddhanta view on the point is this. In order to demarcate a cognition as belonging to a particular individual, it is not necessary that the element of the cogniser should be assumed to appear in that cognition; the fact that the cognition is generated in a particular individual and not in another is enough to effect such a demarcation. To the possible objection, Does the statement of such a coguition include the element that such a cognition is known to be generated in that particular soul?&quot;, the Siddhantin&rsquo;s reply is, &ldquo;No; the fact that the cognition is generated in that particular individual is there; but the knowledge of that is not</p>
<p>included in a statement of that cognition, just as in a sense-perception, the fact that it is a cognition generated through a particular sense-organ is there, but the knowledge of that is not stated; when the cognition is expressed in language. We simply say that we have heard or that we have seen; but we never say that we know that the cognition is produced through the sense of hearing or that it is produced through the sense of sight. Similarly, we simply say that we know; but we do not say that we know that this knowledge is generated in us.”NOTES</p>
<p>[[827]]</p>
<ol start="91">
<li>The Siddhantin continues his attack on the view</li>
</ol>
<p>of Prabhakara. According to Prabhakara, as explained in para 89 above, soul and cognition are perceptible (Cf. Prabhakara&rsquo;s definition of perception, I. i. 24); soul is neither inferred from the concept, &ldquo;I,&rdquo; just as space is inferred from the concept of space; nor is it self-manifest, as in the case of cognition. Still the soul, though perceptible, is not in contact with any sense-organ. Soul is manifested in the cognition itself and does not depend on any other cause.</p>
<p>The Siddhantin objects to something being called perceptible when it is not in contact with a senseorgan; etymologically, it is impossible. Thus it is reasonable to hold that in so far as the soul, when it is being manifested, is not in contact with a sense-organ, the soul is inferred, just as space is inferred. Further, if it is not accepted that the soul, though depending on the self-manifest cognition, is not itself self-manifest, it is impossible to avoid the contingency that the manifestation of the soul which is generated by the cognition, depends on some other cause, just as the manifestation of a jar which is generated by the cognition thereof, depends on some other cause like the sense of sight. And the other alternative, namely, the self-manifestation of the soul, is against the doctrine of</p>
<p>Prabhakara.</p>
<ol start="92">
<li>Here too, the Siddhantin replies to a possible defence of the position of Prabhakara. Prabhakara may say that the soul is not self-manifest, nor does it depend on anything other than a cognition for its manifestation. It is manifest as the abode of the self-manifest cognition, like the fire-wood which shines as the abode of the burning fire, though it is not self-manifest. The reply of the Siddhantin is this. Even in the case of the fire-wood, the part that</li>
</ol>
<p>[[328]]</p>
<p>MÄNAMEYODAYA</p>
<p>burns is identical with fire, and the parts round about, that do not burn but shine, are manifested by the fire nearby, just like a jar or any other thing. Thus nothing is known to shine merely because of being the abode of light.</p>

But in the case of the post, before it is brought into conjunction with the hawk, it has no separation from anything, and when the hawk leaves the post, following on the separation from the hawk, the post has no conjunction with anything. Therefore we do not infer action in the post. This is the Siddhantin&rsquo;s reply. Suppose one hawk leaves the post and, immediately after, another hawk comes and sits on the post; then the post has disjunction from one object and, immediately after, it has conjunction with another. Are we to infer action in the post in such a case? Similarly, suppose there is a pillar fixed firm in a river; at every moment water leaves the pillar and fresh water comes into conjunction with it. Can we infer action in such a pillar?</p>
<p>a.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>Siddhantin further refutes the inferability of action. On a dark night, we see fire-flies falling. How do we know this action in the fire-flies except through perception? The only possible object in which we may be said to see conjunction and disjunction, from which</p>
<p>which the action in the fire-fly is to be inferred, is darkness, and Prabhakara does not accept an entity called darkness. If it be said that there is another object and that is the fire-fly itself, then the reply is that though there is. conjunction of light with the fire-fly, there is no disjunction of the light from the fire-fly. And it has been said in para 6 that it is from conjunction following on disjunction that action is to be inerred.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>Here, the Siddhantin defends his position against a possible objection. If action is perceptible, then a person sitting in a boat and looking only at the boat (without any</li>

<p>possibility of seeing the surrounding objects) does not see the action of the boat, though the boat is moving. This is due to the defect of extreme proximity; and extreme proximity is a defect that vitiates perception. He further defends his position by saying that the size of the boat, which, according to both parties, is perceptible, is not perceived by that person, on account of the same defect.</p>
