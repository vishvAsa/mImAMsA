ANALYTICAL CONTENTS OF SANKARṢAKĀNDA 
The Sankarṣakända consists of four chapters with four Padas in each chapter. There are three hundred and fifty-six adhi- karanas (sections) in the whole work. In both Mimāmsā and Vedanta there is the convention that each Adhikaraṇa should have sangatis or relationships with (1) the previous Adhikaraṇa and (2) with the Sastra (3) Adhyaya and (4) pada in which each Adhikarana falls, but Sankarṣakāṇḍa being a collection of discus- sions that were left out in Mīmāṁsa, for making it complete, no such relationship is needed. The author of the Bhāṣya explicitly says that we need not bother about Sangati (p. 2). He rules out a Sangati even for the first Adhikaraṇa with the last Adhikaraṇa of Pūrvamīmāmsā of which the present work is a continuation (p. 2). But with the exception of the first three pādas each pada has a distinct subject to deal with. The first pada begins with discussions about Anuvaṣaṭkārayāgā a subsidiary sacrifice to the Soma sacrifice and proceeds with the discussions about sacrificial fees, time, etc. In the second pada there are discussions about the observances of the wife  ́of the sacrificer, the Vaimṛdha and Pitṛyegna sacrifices. In the third pada discussions are carried on about the Sakamprasthā- yiya sacrifice and about the use of mantras in dividing the oblations for the various deities. The fourth pada exclusively deals with Yupa, the sacrificial post. The four padas of chapter II deal respectively with discussions about (1) the bricks used in building the sacrificial altar (chayana) (2) avadāna, the act of cutting or separating the oblations for each deity (3) Praișas or commands of the chief priest, and (4) homa or offering the oblations. The four padas of chapter III respectively deal with discussions about (1) times of sacrifices (2) the sacrificial fire (3) Grahas, vessels filled with Soma juice used in Soma sacrifice and (4) varaṇa, appointment of priests. The four padas of chapter IV carry on discussions about (1) mantras recited at the time of kindling the sacrificial fire (2) Nigada a kind of mantra (3) Vaṣaṭkāra mantras recited just before the offering of oblations and (4) Yajyā mantras which precede Vasat- kāras. The contents of Adhikaranas are herein given in detail:--- 
xiv 
Chapter I 
PADA 1. 
Adhikaranas : 
1. Here it is established that the Anuvaṣaṭkārayaga is a separate karma different from the Soma yaga after which it is performed. 
2. This yāga should not be performed from the Soma juice preserved in Dronakalas'a but from the remains of the principal sacrifices. 
3. This yäga should be repeated after each primary yaga. 
4. The drinking of the soma juice which remains after the completion of each yaga should also be repeated. 
- 5. The release of sacrificial animals in Vajapeya sacrifice must be made just after taking the fire-stick round them and not later. 
6. Sautrāmaṇī sacrifice is not a subsidiary (anga) to the altar, or building the altar, but to the sacrifice where the altar is built to house the sacrificial fire. 
7. But the presenting of three bows, without request, to a Brahmin is not an anga of the sacrifice but it is an anga to chayana, building of the altar. 
8. The presentation of the Dakṣiņa or sacrificial fees is a subsidiary to the sacrifice and not to the chayana which is connected with it. 
9. This Dakṣiņa is to be given in addition to the usual fees. It does not cancel it. 
10. The carrying of fire before the sacrificial animal is to be done only once in Vajapeya though there are two The subsidiary animal sacrifices connected with Vājapeya. argument of the siddhantin is that the object of carrying fire is cooking which is one and not the extinction of Asuras as indicated by the Arthavada which is only an exaltation of the sacrifice. 
xii 
11. Fire is to be brought along with the Vapa only once as in the case of carrying it in the previous Adhikaraṇa. 
12. In the Agniṣomiya animal sacrifice it is said that two homas should be performed on both sides of the Vapă. Here the words "on both sides" do not indicate the place where homa is to be performed, but rather the time when it should be performed. Thus these homas should be performed before and after the Vapā homa. 
13. In the re-kindling of fire (Punarādhana) the text "two homas have to be performed on both sides of the sacrificial cake" should also be interpreted in the same way. 
14. In the Darśapārņamāsa sacrifice, at the time of pounding the rice the summoning mantra-"O the maker of the offering! Please come here" refers to the wife of the sacrificer and not to the priest, Adhvaryu, nor the speech (1). 
15. In the Agniṣomīya sacrifice it is said. "the divine and human killers! begin." Here by the word human killers the Adhvaryu priest and his deputies are meant and not all men nor even all priests employed in the sacrifice. 
PADA II. 
1. In the Darśapūrṇamasa sacrifice the reference to the wife, in the command "Tie the wife" is to the wife of the sacrificer and not to the wife of the priest. 
2. Again if there are two or more wives for a sacrificer all wives have to be tied. 
3. When there are six sacrifices but the mantras required for offering the oblation are only two in number, the first mantra is to be utilised for the first three sacrifices, and the second for the last three. 
4. When there is only one primary rite and many mantras all subsidiary to it, all the mantras are to be used in the sacrifice optionally. 
5. Here the primafacie view that another sacrifice with Purodāśa (cake) for the deity Indra is enjoined in between Agneya and Sannayya sacrifices in Darśa yaga is rejected. 
xiii 
6. The Primafacie view that Vaimṛdha sacrifice is to be performed along with the Pärṇamāsa sacrifice is rejected and its performance later is established. 
7. The Vaimṛdha sacrifice is optional in the beginning. Only when it is performed once it becomes obligatory afterwards. 
8. "If these animal sacrifices are performed, then the head of the animal connected with Vayu sacrifice should be placed in the altar" - Here also the animal sacrifices are not obligatory because of the use of the word 'if'. 
9. It is not that the Vaimṛdha sacrifice performed in the beginning leads to its obligatoriness afterwards, but whenever it is performed once, it should not be abandoned afterwards, but should be continued. 
10. The text "He should perform two sacrifices" in the context of Darśapärṇamāsa, refers to the repetition of the sacrifices two times and not to Darśa and 'abhyudita' sacrifices. (This latter is performed when one begins the Darśa in the 14th day of declining moon, under the illusion that it is Newmoon day). 
11. The bringing of fire to Ahavaniya, performed after Agnihotra in the morning of the New moon day is an accessory to Darsa Sacrifice to be performed the next day and not to the Pindapit sacrifice performed in the afternoon of the same day. 
12. When the moon is slightly visible on the former day and invisible on the New Moon day this sacrifice should be performed only on the latter day and not on the former. 
13. The oblations cooked in the Dakṣiņagni fire in that sacrifice (Pindapitṛyagna) should be offered in Dakshinagni and not in Ahavaniya as other oblations. 
14. It should be performed not only by those that have kindled the Śrauta fire but also by those that have not, (in the Smarta fire). 
16. Prayer which is conducted after offering' is also before that Smärtha fire. We need not bring in Garhapatya fire in whose name prayer stands. 
xiv 
17. If it be said that the word Garhapatya in the prayer does not indicate the Smarta fire, the Siddhantin says, that the word whose sense does not suit the context should be dropped while praying. 
18. The Vedic text "He should perform the Agnisomiya sacrifice in Amāvāsyä, who desires to conquer enemies", is an injunction of the sacrifice of that name for the attainment of that fruit, and the association of the Soma deity for the agneya sacrifice which is contextual is what is new here. 
19. This Pournamāsī sacrifice is not to be taken as obligatory- cum-optional but only a modification of the obligatory yaga. 
PADA III. 
1. In the Sākamprasthāyîya () sacrifice, performed in the New moon, simultaneity in offering is only for the Sannäyya 
(milk and curds) oblation and not for others also. 
2. If it be said that by the introduction of pots the usual vessel called Sruk () is to be abandoned- 
Discussion in the middle 
3. If it be said that different pots should be used in milking (the cow) and offering it to the deities, the Siddhantin answers that as two pots are used in milking and three in offering there is difference. 
The Siddhanta of the primary discussion is that in offering we can employ the mud pots or wooden vessels. 
4. In this Yaga there is no utilisation of the remains of the primary yāga. 
5. Upastarana and Abhighāraṇa (3) should not be done in performing this yāga. 
6. The commands of Adhvaryu, namely (1) Chant for Indra ( आश्रावय ) (2) Let the Hota hear the commands (अस्तु श्रौष्ट) and (3) (4) Chant the Yajya mantras, should be made on the respective occasions and not all in the beginning of the yaga..jexv 
XV 
7. In the Dākṣāyaṇa Sacrifice (4) there is repetition only for Pūrṇamāsa sacrifice and not for Darsa. 
8. This repetition is to be undertaken twice in each Full moon and New moon day. 
9. The observances like "He should not utter falsehood" connected with this sacrifice should be undertaken in each dark half of the month and not always. 
10. Performance throughout life which is important for Darsapurṇamāsa sacrifice is not necessary for modified sacrifices like Sourya sacrifice. 
11. Expiatory observances on the growing of tender leaves in Yupa is necessary not only in the modified yāgas which last for a long time but also in Soma which is completed in 5 days. 
12. "Whether it be Işti or Pasu or Soma, he should perform a yāga by its side". Here a particular place for the sacrifice is not prescribed but the old fire. 
Discussion in the middle 
This fire too is prescribed for sacrifices excluding Soma sacrifice since it has Soma for oblation. 
Final view 
The whole passage is only a complementary passage for prescribing special bricks for chayana in the Soma yāga. 
13. These particular bricks, called Lokam prņas should be used in ordinary Soma sacrifices also, and there is no evidence to say that they should be used only in Soma sacrifices with altar. 
14. The Darbha grass meant for Soma sacrifices is not to be used in Istis in Somayaga. But the grass used in the Atithya Işți should be spread over the grass of the Soma yaga in addition to it. 
15. In Agniṣomiya sacrifice the branch of a fig tree which is ordained should not be taken over to Savaniya sacrifice but should be used in Agniṣomīya itself in addition to Darbha grass. The grass does not cancel the fig branch. 
xvi 
16. "Spread the Darbha grass " ordained in Savaniya sacrifice refers to the Darbha grass of the Soma sacrifice. 
17. The instruction "Please be divided" observed in the Darsa sacrifice refers to the sacrificial cakes and not to the deities concerned. 
18. The mantras "this is for Agni" "This is for Agni and Soma" etc., should be uttered after dividing the cake among deities. 
19. The same conclusion in regard to 'for Agni' etc., is to be accepted. 
20. In case of many yāgas performed with cakes the word व्यावर्तेथां (dual) is to be changed as व्यावर्तध्व. 
21. But where there are two yāgas and two cakes no change is necessary. 
22. This indication of deities should be made in respect of the last two sacrifices only. 
23. When the materials for cake and cooked rice are divided before baking and cooking, the mantras chanted when dividing should also be brought. 
24. In group sacrifices the cakes and cooked rice should be grouped distinctly and mantras chanted only once for each group. There is no chanting for each deity, 
25. In group sacrifies which are performed separately and where there are cakes and cooked rice the materials for each should be divided with words, This is for these deities' 'this for the other deities'.. 
26. The same rule should be followed in group sacrifices which are performed together. 
27. But in the Işți called Sarvaprstha (g) there is no division and hence no chanting of mantras. 
PADA IV. 
1. The yäga performed with whey is different from that performed with curds. This whey does not lead to the perfor- mance of the yāga. (This Satra is for reminding the Siddhanta adopted in chapter IV of Pārva Mīmāmsā.) 
xvii 
1. "In the Caturmasya yaga the oblation of Amikṇā (curds) is to be mixed up with whey." Here since the whey obtained in making the curds was used in the separate yāga the question arises whether another whey is to be produced for mixing with curds. The Siddhantin holds the view that the whey obtained in making curds should be utilised both in the yaga and in mixing with the curds. 
2. The Svistakṛdyaga (e) must be performed for Amikṣā sacrifice also. The Anuvaşatkarayaga which is per- formed in the place of Svistakṛt after the Vajina sacrifice is a subsidiary for that yaga and hence does not serve the purpose of Sviştakrt for the Amikṣā sacrifice. 
3. This Anuvaşaṭkarayaga must be performed with what remains of Vajinayaga because of the usage of the word 'anu'. There is no filling of the cup with Vajina again. 
4. In some animal sacrifices it is said that the Yupa (sacrificial post) should have branches. This is not for some unseen purpose. It is for some seen result. 
5. The purificatory acts performed for ordinary Yupas should also be performed for the branches of the Yupa. 
6. The Yupa should have branches above its waist-height and below the rope tied round it. 
7. The words 
and found in the yupa-mantra 
should be changed as अग्राभ्यां and मध्याभ्यां. 
8. The height prescribed for the Yupa, namely five spans, should be taken as five spans above the ground level. The Yupa portion buried in the ground is not to be taken into account. 
9. Tying round the yupa in its waist-height is also to be taken from the ground level. 
10. 'Yapa should measure five spans'. Here the span used in measuring the yapa is performer's span and not that of anybody else. 
11. "The wings and tail of the sacrificial alter should have the measurement of the space between one's right and left hands stretched." Here the space referred to has no relation with the performer's hands. The hands of any human being will do. 
xviii 
12. But with regard to the injunction. "He should take out four handfuls of rice" the hand of Adhvaryu who is function ing is to be taken into account. 
13. In the yaga where there are eleven yupas it is said "The ropes of all the yupas should be tied to the middle Yupa called Agniṣṭha" Here the tying is a purificatory act for the Yupa and not for the ropes. 
Discussion in the middle 
14. All these should be tied in the middle of the Yupa simultaneously. 
15. This rule should apply to modified sacrifices where there are two ropes. Answer. 
Answer. The tying and untying of the ropes should not be simultaneous. The ropes must be tied in order. 
16. The Mantra ya garer: chanted when Yupa is tied around is not to be repeated for each rope. For all ropes chanting once is enough. 
17. All this was said in the view that the tying the ropes round the Yupa is a purificatory act for Yapa, but it is not so; it is a purificatory act for the ropes. 
18. In some modified sacrifice where eleven Yapas are pro- hibited and one Yupa recommended, all the purificatory acts pertaining to Yupa prescribed in the archetypal sacrifice should be carried out. 
19. These Yupas excepting the middle should be consecrated at the time of the Yaga, since proximity of Angas, with Pradhāna is needed. The middle Yupa alone should be consecrated on the previous day as it is done in the archetypal sacrifice. 
20. In this view the consecration of the ten Yūpas should be done only once. 
Discussion in the middle 
But in the group yägas to be performed for many days, this consecration should be repeated for each yupa. Answer. Not so. Though the Yagas are performed each day the consecration of the Yupas is only once, 
xix 
21. In the yaga where there are eleven Yupas, one Yupa should be planted before the fire and five on either side of it. 
22. The space between two Yupas must be equal to the yoke of a cart. 
23. The space enjoined in the text "The space should be equal to the Vedi" should not be taken as an alternative to the previous one. 
24. The ten Yupas should be planted from south to north excepting the tenth which should be planted southeast of the altar. 
25. There are several optional ways of planting the Yupa e. g., "If one is desirous of Svarga he should plant half the Yupa into the ground and leave half above." 
26. The eleven animal sacrifices once enjoined are again prescribed in the reverse order. This performing in the reverse order pertains to Ahīna yāgas and not to the archetypal sacrifice.CHAPTER II 
PADA I. 
1. In the statement "He should build the altar with bricks", the bricks prescribed are to be made of clay and not of metal. 
2. They should have four sides. 
3. They should be rectangular. 
4. If, when building the Agni or the sacrificial altar there falls gaps between bricks, special bricks to fill the gaps need not be produced. 
5. In the text "Bricks of all colours should be produced" the word 'colours' should be taken in the sense of lines (Rekhās) as per context. 
6. These bricks should be baked. 
7. The fire for baking the clay bricks must be brought about by churning. The Vedic fire should not be taken out on any 
account. 
8. In bricks called : (grass used as bricks) all purifica- tory rites relevant to bricks should be performed since they are also bricks. 
9. 
Though sands are also used in building the altar the mantra should not be chanted for them. 
10. Herbs and cooked rice should be placed in the base of the altar, but rites relating to bricks should not be performed in them. 
11. "He should place the Nirrti bricks" Here the purifica- tory rites of bricks should not be performed. 
12. "He should build with a thousand". Here the word thousand does not indicate a yaga where fee is thousand; it rather indicates thousand bricks. 
13. The same conclusion in regard to the text build with thousand'. 
14, The mantra (1) should be chanted in the construction of altars with two, three and four thousand bricks also, since the word Sahasra indicates exaltation and not the exact number one thousand. 
xxi 
qu 
15. All the bricks should not be laid by chanting mantra alone. Bricks to be laid by all the mantras is one thousand. 
16. When the number of bricks increases in a chayana they should be laid by repeating the 
in the Veda as always fresh. contextual mantras for this. 
mantra which is spoken of 
We need not repeat other 
17. The word 'chiti' used in the building of the altar indi- cates a layer made of bricks and mortar. 
18. In the Vedic injunction "He should lay the bricks east- ward" what is meant is that laying of the bricks should end in the eastern direction and not that the priest should face east and lay the bricks. 
19. But in the Vedic mandate "He should lay the last brick westward" what is meant is that the agent should face west when laying that brick. 
20. In the Vedic statement "He should place the tortoise eastward" what is meant is that the tortoise should face east. 
21. In the statement "He should lay other bricks westward. Then he should lay yet others eastward" the purport is that laying should be completed in the west and east respectively. 
22. In the statement "He should deposit the 
(bull) in each layer, the word 'bull' does not mean the animal of that name, but bricks to be laid with the Vedic mantra containing that word. (वामवृषमं etc.) 
23. In the statement "He should deposit the Prāṇabhṛt" souls are not meant but the bricks to be laid with mantras containing that word are meant. 
:". 
Here 
24. "He should deposit the ghee-bricks what is meant is that small pots filled with ghee should be deposited and not that the bricks are to be laid with mantras containing that word. 
25. In the text "He should deposit Vikarni and five chodas" bricks with a particular shape are not meant but only rectangular bricks useful in Chayana. 
xxii 
yo 26. In the Soma sacrifice, with the altar, the purificatory acts pertaining to the Vedi (sacred place) should be performed only on the altar as the altar is adopted in the place of Vedi, and not on the ground on which the altar stands. 
27. Chayana should be performed side by side with the Upasadyaga and not before that. 
28. The making of the bricks should be commenced only after Dikṣā (taking certain vows) and not before that. 
29. Soma sacrifice with Chayana can be undertaken even where the days of Dikṣa are one, two or there, since persons without Dikṣā can make bricks after performing the Prajapati sacrifice a month beforehand. There is no fear of bricks left unbacked before yāga. 
30. Chayana can be performed even five or more times. There is no rule that one should stop after performing it thrice. 
31. But from the fourth onwards, the size of the altar should be bigger than the previous ones. 
32. The number of bricks also for the fourth and other Chayanas should be greater. 
33. The mantras to be chanted when laying the bricks should be brought from the Rg Veda. The mantras found in the context should not be used. 
34. In case the mantras in the context are made use of, then to cope with the number of bricks, each mantra has to be used more than once. 
35. When we take the mantras from Rg Veda we must take all mantras which extol Agni. 
36. But we cannot increase the number of bricks to cope with the mantras. One Sakta should be chanted for each brick, and not one mantra. 
37. These mantras should be used only in building the altar and not in chanting before Agni. 
38. Among the mantras taken from Rg Veda, those in Gayatri and other metres are enjoined for those who aspire for some special benefit. Those who do not aspire for any special benefit should chant only mantras in other metres. 
ixxiii 
39. The text "The Agni (altar) should have a head" does not mean that a real head should be fixed on it; some particular bricks to be laid on the top are meant here. 
40. The form of the altar need not be necessarily like that of an eagle. It may be like that of any bird. 
41. For the altar, the eagle's form is not obligatory-cum- optional. It is only optional. 
42. Both the mantras gor and are not intended for laying the bricks. The former is intended for laying the bricks and the latter for chanting before them. 
PADA II. 
1. "It (the iron rod intended for baking the heart of the animal) should not be thrown away in the Agnisomiya and Savaniya yāgas" This means that it should be preserved till the end of the Anubandhya yaga. It does not mean that there is no iron rod for those two yägas. 
2. In the Vanaspati sacrifice the Yupa is not the deity, but Vanaspati itself is the deity. 
3. In the Vedic text स्रुवेण पार्वणौ होमी जुहोति the word Parvapa indicates the deity and not the time. 
4. In the Işti sacrifices which are auxiliary to the Somayaga the mantra etc., read in the context does not exclude the other subsidiary acts which are transferred from the archetypal sacrifice (here, Darśapūraṇamāsa). 
5. In the Vedic text age (He should throw into the sacrificial fire the oblation of slices cut four times") cutting slices from the heap four times refers to only the Homas which are performed by वषट्कार and not the दविहोम s. 
6. And for those born in the line of the sage Jamadagni the taking out five times instead of four, applies only to Homas where there is a for others, and not to all Homas. 
For the progeny of Jamadagni the extra cutting is from the Puroḍāśa and other hard oblations and not from clarified 
butter. 
8. The fifth 
χχίν 
(cutting) is to be made just after the (purifying with 
second from the Puroḍaśa and not after ghee). 
9. The third cutting for those in Jamadagni line is to be made from the northern half of the Puroḍāśa. 
10. In the text "He should sacrifice for Vanaspati with oblation taken once" it is meant that the third cutting enjoined for Jamadagnis should not be made. 
11. In the text यदपरमवदानं तत्पूर्वमवदाय, पूर्व and अपर do not refer to space or time but to the action. As such, there is difference in as much as one has a mantra but not the other. 
12. The same Nyaya is to be applied to other examples. 
13. In Darśapūrṇamāsa yāga the statement "there is clarified butter taken sixteen times" is not a new injunction, but a reference to the aggragate of spoonfuls of ghee in the yaga. 
14. Though the statement "He who is desirous of Svarga should have clarified butter taken seventeen times" is observed in the context of Agnihotra, it should be taken over to Darśa- pūrṇamāsa where there are seventeen spoonfuls, according to some sage. 
15. In the Işti where there are three puroḍāśa cakes to be offered to three deities, the cutting of slices from them is simultaneous. 
16. But they should be offered to the respective deities one by one, since the deities are different. 
17. This a 
(cutting). should not be enforced in sacrifice since it is prohibited there. 
18. In the animal sacrifice there is the sprinkling of clarified butter over the three parts (of the animal) since its sprinkling is done only for making the oblation soft, and softening is required in them. 
19. In the animal sacrifice the offering to the deity should not follow immediately after cutting each part, but it should be made simultaneously after taking out all the parts.XXV 
PADA III. 
1. The commands (4) are issued for drawing the attention of the respective priests. They are not done merely for obtaining the unseen effect. 
2. In the commands of the name of the deity should be added. 
3. The command 
issued in the Anuyāja sacrifice refers only to the deities of the first Anāyāja and not to all of them. 
4. The increase of the number of Prayājas to eleven in the animal sacrifice should be from their respective places. 
5. The tenth Anuyāja is a modification of the first. 
6. In the animal sacrifice the last six Prayājas are the modifications of fourth and the fifth Prayājas of the original sacrifice. 
7. The eleven commands of Maitravaruna priest in the अनूयाज of the animal sacrifice are the modifications of the first command in the Darśa Purṇamāsayāga. 
8. The text उपप्रेष्य हव्याहोतर्देवेभ्यः is a command and not the repetition of a command. 
9. This should be issued by Adhvaryu to Maiträvaruṇa and not to Hotr. 
10. The command is common to sacrifices which have stotras and Sastras and also to those which have not. 
11. Because of the usage of plural as this should be transferred to group sacrifices lasting for many days. 
12. "Adhvaryu should divide that oblation before" Here the word 'before' refers to the front place and not to priority in time. 
13. In the sacrifices made to please the Season gods Maitra- varuņa priest should issue the command. 
14. In the yāgas performed with vessels refilled with Soma the command refers only to the priest hotṛ. 
15. In the sacrifice called Anuvaṇaṭkāra yāga there is no (command). 
iv 
xxvi 
PADA IV. 
1. In places where the deities are read along with the oblations, e.g., आग्नेयोऽष्टाकपाल: we should understand that sacrifices 
are meant. 
2. In sacrifices where any deity is not mentioned some deity should be presumed. 
3. Throwing of sticks with mantras is not a Homa; it is intended only to make the fire shine. 
4. All mantras are to be utilised in this, since all are read in one place. 
5. In the context of the Citra sacrifice is mentioned "He should perform these Homas". Here only the mantras that indicate nourishment are to be used and not all that are read in 
the context. 
6. In the Homas called "Darvi Homas" (Those performed with a small spoon) the clarified butter should be taken only once for each Homa and not four times for each as in other Homas. 
7. When many Homas are to be performed at a stretch the clarified butter should be taken separately for each Homa and not collectively. 
8. In Darvihomas also fuel sticks should be thrown into fire before each Homa. 
9. The word "Pāka yajña" refers only to a special variety of yajñas. 
10. They are not of the nature of Işțis but 'Darvihomas'. 11. Among Darvihomas only those that are enjoined in Smrtis are Pākayagñas. 
12. By the Śruti textaff etc.. not only the nature of Pakayajñas is mentioned but also their procedure. 
13. In the Śruti text "He should sacrifice for Viśvedevas on the ground sloping eastward" the place mentioned is not a substitute for the Ahavaniya fire, but it is the place on which that fire should be kindled. 
14. But in statements like "He should offer oblations on the foot prints" "on the path" etc., fire is precluded. 
xxvii 
The statement "He should perform the Homa on the crossway on a burning stick" should not be interpreted as on the crossway or on the burning stick. The Homa should be performed as 
mentioned. 
15. In the Vedic text "They should perform Avabhṛtha westward," both the place and the priests should face west. 
16. The mantras which end with the word for offering oblations. 
are meant 
17. In the mantras "" etc., where is not the ending word we need not add another '' for oblations. It can function from wherever it is read (e.g.) give for Brahmins; for Brahmins, give etc. 
18. In the statement स्वाहाकृत्य ब्रह्मणा ते जुहोमि the word स्वाहा being connected with the root कृत् has no connection with जुहोमि. 
19. In the same way in वषट् ते विष्णवास आकृणोमि the word वषट् being syntactically connected with of does not indicated homa. 
20. In the af a subsidiary to the animal sacrifice, the deities who were previously propitiated are not to be indicated in the mantras. 
21. In the जयाहोम the mantra चितं च स्वाहा should be chanted as it is. There is no change of case as rart.

Thus the two mantras are to be

24. In the view that the mantras read in the context of Rājasāya should be chanted the word should be omitted. It is to be used only in offering the oblations. 
Discussion in the middle 
वषट् 
25. In the offering of Soma to the Seasons, the word in the mantra should also be omitted. 
xxviii 
Final View: Since the word 
is not always meant for 
offering oblations the word in the mantras should not be omitted. 
26. In the mantra 
the second Homa is to be performed with the mantra ताभ्यः स्वाहा and there is no grouping of 
the two mantras according to the gender. 
27. The injunction 
not restrict the mantras to six. 
(he should offer six times) does Hence both the two groups of 
mantras आकूत्यै प्रयुजे and आकूतमग्नि must be chanted. 
28. In the text "He should perform the seventh Homa with the mantra a etc., the word 'seventh' should be taken in the sense of 'thirteenth' as twelve Homas have to be performed as per previous section. 
29. There are two Vedic injunctions relating to the mantra beginning with . One says that he (the sacrificer) should perform five Homas with it while the other, ten Homas. Here there is no option between five and ten but the former is a partial restatement (अवयुत्यानुवाद.) 
30. In the injunction" भूतमव्यं भविष्यद्वषट् स्वाहा नमः all the words वषट्, स्वाहा नमः are not intended for offering the oblations. They rather glorify the Homas. 
CHAPTER III 
PADA I. 
1. The Dars'a and Pūrṇamāsa sacrifices should be performed on the day in which the sun and the moon are farthest from and closest to each other respectively. 
2. Both these sacrifices should be performed in two days. 
3. They should be performed in the day time and not in the night time. 
4. Darśa sacrifice should be begun before sunrise while the Purnamasa should be begun after sunrise. 
5. In the Soma yaga too the , the sacrifice with soma juice, should be performed on the day in which there is the meeting of पर्व and प्रतिपत्. 
6. The text "he should not perform another işți between the kindling of fire and the Porṇamāsa" refers only to istis which are occasional and not others. 
7. Agrayana sacrifice should be separately performed for barley also, in addition to that for rice. 
8. If it be said that in the sacrifices performed with rice, barley and other grains there is mantra for the eating of the remains in all, the Siddhantin replies that only those that have mantras in the archetypal sacrifice have mantras in the modified sacrifice. 
9. The text "One who has not performed the Agrayana sacrifice should not eat the new grains" refers to all kinds of grains grown in villages. 
10. If it be said that even greens should not be cooked before Agrayana, the Siddhantin says that they can be dealt with in any manner, since they are not fit for yāga and only those that are fit for sacrifice are prohibited from being cooked before yāga. 
11. This prohibition does not include green and other grams since they are meant for making the food delicious; they are not themselves food, 
12. He who has already taken barley as food need not perform Agrayana with barley.xxx aji 
13. This Agrayana should be performed even by those who have no grains for themselves and by those who are not hungry. 
14. The text "Having once performed the yaga with rice he should always take up rice" means that the Dars'a or Pärnamäsa sacrifice performed in the period falling between the two Agrayanas should be performed with rice or barley as the case may be. 
• 
15. If it be said that rice, barley and other grains are enjoined in the Agrayana optionally, the Siddhantin replies that three yagas each having one of these corns are herein enjoined. 
16. In the statement "This should be performed after a year" the word 'year' refers to the time when the corn ripens and not twelve months. 
17. In the Caturmasya sacrifice in which each 'parva' or group of sacrifices is performed in every four months, the word 'month' refers to the luner month. 
18. In the statement "Having performed during the three, he should leave the fourth" month is referred to and not the year. 
19. The statement "Having performed yāgas for three seasons in the year consecutively, he should refrain from performing yāgas for two seasons; he should stop" does not mean that the sixth sacrifice should not be begun: The whole passage is syntactically connected with the injunction "He should perform Darśa and Purnamasa for life." 
20. The Homas performed for propitiating the deities of Vaiśvānara, Parjanya and others at the beginning of a five year undertaking of Darśa yaga, need not be repeated at the beginning of the sixth year. They are like Arambhaniya iṣṭis. 
21. "If the sacrifice is undertaken in winter he should spill the clarified butter once". Here the Vaiśvadeva yaga which is predominent in the context is not meant. But Varuṇapraghasa which is performed in winter is meant. 
22. "He should perform the Vaiśvadeva yaga in the season in which there is abundant milk in cows": In this statement seasons other than spring are not meant. But, the spring season of any year in which cows give abundant milk is to be chosen. The spring is enjoined for Vaiśvadeva yāga and this should not be given up. 
xxxi 
23. "He who desires cows, should perform Vaisvadeva yāga alone and not Varuṇa praghāsa and others". Here what is meant is that the Vaisvadeva yaga should be repeated until cows are obtained. It does not mean that other yägas should be given up. 
24. "He should perform Darśapūrṇamāsa for a month". Here the word means thirty days. The text does not mean that the yaga should be performed each new and full moon day for thirty months. 
PADA II. 
1. The fire obtained by churning the log of wood (for) in Adhana is the source of Garhapatya fire alone and not of all fires. 
2. Other fires should be obtained from the Garhapatya fire and not from other sources known in the world. 
3. Sabhya and Avasathya fires are not be taken from Ahavaniya. They should be produced from ordinary means. 
4. The Daksinagni should be produced from garhapatya fire. 5. All fires should not be preserved. Garhapatya alone should be preserved. When one sacrifice is over the Ahavaniya will go to Garhapatya. At the beginning of another sacrifice Ahavaniya will be taken from Garhapatya to its place. 
6. If it be said that Adhana should be performed for each sacrifice, the Siddhantin says that if a man is rich he should preserve all the three fires always; if he is poor he should maintain Garhapatya alone and the other fires should be taken out from it at the beginning of each Karma. 
7. Dakşinagni also is produced only once by Adhāna. It is made manifest at the beginning of each Karma. 
8. This mainfestation is also from Garhapatya and not by churning the arani. 
9. The prayer to Ahavaniya fire is to be offered only when it is manifest in its own place and not when it is hidden in Garhapatya. 
10. When the sacrifice is over Āhavaniya and others are not Vedic though they are preserved. The unseen Āhavaniya passes on to Garhapatya. 
11. In the Soma sacrifice we need not take out Āhavaniya for each işți since it is kept manifest till the end of Soma. 
xxxii 
12. In the Soma yaga only a part of the Ahavaniya fire is brought to the safe and not the whole of it. 
13. After the Ahavaniya is brought to the remaining fire is calledfarge. It then becomes Garhapatya. 
14. This Salamukhīya is not Āhavaniya afterwards. 
15. All rites ordained in Garhapatya should not be performed in Salamukhiya. The cooking of the animal's parts should be made in sea which was Garhapatya before. 
16. The Agnidhriya fire should be taken from Śalāmukhiya and not from Ahavaniya. 
17. The fires to be deposited in various posts are to be taken from Agnidhriya fire. 
18. If it be said that the fara fires are to be rekindled only thrice, the Siddhantin rejoins that there is rekindling (ag) for a forth time at the end of the Soma yäga. 
19. These fires should be 
be rekindled in each savana (extraction of Soma juice) 
20. This rekindling is by Soma or Ghee in the first two Savanas and by ghee alone in the third Savana. 
21. Again the vessel used in rekindling is and not 
or चमस. 
22. In the Soma sacrifice Vaisarjana homas should be performed with clarified butter and not with Soma juice which is reserved for the primary sacrifice. 
23. The fire which is to be used to cook the parts of the animal is a or churned fire and not Ahavanıya. 
24. Śalamukhiya fire is to be produced in A also since in the Agnişomiya its archetype it is enjoined. 
25. In case there is işti before and after Pagubandha, the fires produced in the preceding işți should be preserved up to the end of the animal sacrifice. 
26. Assuming that the taking over of fire undertaken on the previous day itself in 
should be 
sacrifice, we 
discuss whether the Agnihotra of the previous evening should be performed in the second Ahavaniya or in the original. The Siddhantin declares that it should be performed in the second. 
Discussion in the middle 
27. The cooking of the oblations of the Agnihotra should be made in the original Garhapatya and not in the new one. 
28. The baking of the Purodasa in the Purodasa sacrifice following the animal sacrifice is to be made in the a fire as it functions in the place of Garhapatya, and not in the gf fire. 29. In the reg an animal sacrifice which is a modifica- tion of अग्नीषोमीय the उत्तरवेदि should be consecrated the same day and not the previous day as in the original. 
30. In the animal sacrifice and in the वरुणप्रधास, शालमुखीय fire should be consecrated, according to the view of Bodhayana. 
31. At the end of Somayaga the Garhapatya fire alone is to be preserved and not others. They become ordinary fires. 
32. But in the alternative in which all fires are preserved they also should be preserved by carrying it in the Arani. 
33. If in the Soma yaga the performer has to travel before casting off the he cannot take the fires with him directly. He must bring over the fires into the Arani (log of wood) by mantra and take it with him. 
34. If it be said different fors are required for bringing the different fires, to, avoid mingling we say no; since the fires are of the nature of unseen effects there is no reason for confusion. 
35. Even when the fires are brought through the Aranis the fire shonld be brought directly. 
36. In the Somayaga with the altar, the other fires are to be brought home only through some medium. 
37. This medium must be either Arani or the atman. 
38. In case, the fires are brought in atman they should be released on the arani and not on ordinary fires. 
PADA III. 
1. In the Soma sacrifice the fa: (vessels filled with Soma) which are not enjoined in the context should be treated on a par with those enjoined in the context. 
V 
χχχίν 
2. These should be employed only in the original Somayāga and not in विश्वजित्. 
3. The prohibition of afT: elsewhere pertains to the modified sacrifice called 34 and not to the original Somayäga. 
4. It is optional. 
These should be prepared one each day in yāgas which have many पृष्ठय stotras and which have बृहत् and रथन्तरपृष्ठय stotras only. 
6. In the text वैराजस्य स्तोत्रायाग्नेयोगृह्यते Agni is the deity and not the stotra though it is mentioned in the dative case. 
7. These should be offered next to माहेन्द्रग्रह याज्या Mantras for them are the same as that of माहेन्द्रग्रह. 
8. The with curds (a) is obligatory. It should be filled only after 3 and other grahas though it is said to be ज्येष्ठ ( elder ). 
9 & 10. The mantra 
fe is to be chanted in filling the cup with curds, अपेन्द्रद्विषतः in handling it, and प्राणाय in pouring it into fire. 
11. This ag is not an injunction of a subsidiary for the attainment of a result ( फलाय गुणविधिः ) but it is the injunction of homa combined with curds for the attainment of fruits. 
12. This is obligatory. 
13. In the Somagraha enjoined for the attainment of ब्रह्मवर्चस by the injunction सोमग्रहं गृह्णीयाद्ब्रह्मवर्चसकामस्य the purificatory acts of Soma should not be performed. It is a modification of दविग्रह. 
14. But there is extraction of juice from Soma, without which the yaga is impossible. 
15. The purport of the injunction तिस्रो बहस्य समिधः इत्येतया is that the mantra should be chanted during extraction 
of juice from Soma. 
16. Though the ty and Grahas are mentioned after the completion of Soma sacrifice, Yagas are to be performed with them before afgue, according to the sequence of the mantras.XXXV 
17. These two Grahas are both obligatory and fruit-bearing." 18. In the context of stotras where Soma is not enjoined, both Graha and Camasa are to be employed. 
19. पृश्निग्रह and प्राणग्रह mentioned in this context should be taken as additional Grahas. 
20. The Я 
beginning with я 
should be filled up by chanting the mantra 
and not etc., given in the context. 
21. In the Dvadasaha it is said that gf and Grahas should be mixed up. The mixing of mantras is to be done when Soma is measured (मानकाले ). 
22. These Grahas which are not mentioned in any context should be taken over to the Dvadaśaha sacrifice. 
PĀDA IV. 
1. The injunction of refers to request to be made to the ancestors of the performer of the sacrifice and not to those of any priest. 
2. The ancestral Rṣis of the sacrificer should not be mentioned by mere names. Their names should be connected with the sacrificer (eg) 
etc. 
3. The injunctions and a quita should be taken together. Three persons who are seers of mantras should be mentioned. 
4. Hota should mention their names in the natural order and Adhvaryu in the reverse order. 
5. In the mention of Pravaras the alternative of should be adopted only by Brahmins. For Kṣatriyas and Vais'yas the Pravaras of the Purohit has to be mentioned, since they have no Ṛsis as Pravaras. 
6. For Nisadas and Rathakaras who are eligible to perform certain sacrifices the names of the Rṣis whom they claim as pravaras should be mentioned. 
7. For Brahmins who earn their living by performing the duties of Ksatriyas and for Kṣatriyas who earn their living by 
xxxvi 
performing the duties of Brahmins Pravaras are to be mentioned, according to their birth and not according to their adopted vocation, when they perform yagas. 
8. For those who have two gotras two pravaras from ones gotra and one from the other gotra are to be mentioned. 
9. In the the appointment of Rtviks in the middle of the sacrifice, is only for those who are eligible to pronounce the epithet and not for all. 
10. This appointment is to be made only by ordinary language and not by mantras used in the 
sacrifice. 
11. But for the followers of certain Sakhas the mantra इन्द्रं होतात् should be used. 
12. The injunction quà does not mean that the request should be made seven times but it means that seven persons are to be requested. 
13. The Vedic text द्वितीयमाश्रावयति द्वौ ह्यत्र होतारौ though read in the context of दैक्षयाग should be transferred to निरूढपशु since the absence of the third Hota implied in it does not apply to दैक्षपशुयाग. 
14. The appointment of should be made the day preceding the देक्षायाग. 
XXXVII 
CHAPTER IV 
PADA I. 
1. The sequence of the mantras to be chanted in the yaga for सामिधेनी is (1) दशहोतृ (2) व्याहृतयः ( 3 ) हिंकार : ( 4 ) सामिधेन्यः. 
2. The Samidheni mantras are to be chanted in the medium tone. 
3. होतुरन्तर्वेद्येकः पादो भवति बहिर्वेकः. Here the word Pada does not refer to the quarters of the Samidhani mantras but to the foot of Hotä. 
4. Eleven mantras are read as Samidhenis, we have to make them fifteen. For this we have to repeat the first and the last mantras thrice. No new mantra from Rg Veda is to be brought for this. 
6. सन्ततमुत्तरमर्षर्चमालमेत. Here the injunction of सान्तत्य or continuity pertains to all the three repetitions and not to the last alone. 
6. The injunction यः कामयेत सर्वमायुरियामिति त्रिरनवानमनूष्य etc., should be interpreted as before. 
7. In the Vedic mandate ता एकश्रुति सन्ततमनुब्रूयात् the word ता: refers to the first and the last mantras and not to all mantras. 
8. 'एकैकामेव सन्तन्वन्' Here सन्तान or continuity is enjoined only for Riks and not to the halves of Ṛks. 
9. By the text राथन्तरीं प्रथमामन्वाह बाईतीमुत्तमां we should not bring the Riks of रथन्तर and बृहत् साम. This is only an exaltation of the first and last Ṛks. 
10. '' Here the declaration of splitting is in respect of the middle Rk. 
11. 'समिद्वती घृतषती चानूच्येते ' Here only the words समित् and are mentioned and not the Ṛks containing those words. 
12. 'ऋचि प्रणवं दघाति' According to this injunction we have Thus देवान to pronounce at as the last syllable of each Ṛk. जिगाति सुम्नयुः ओं becomes देवान् जिगाति सुम्नयों making a small modifica- tion in the last syllable. 
xxxviii 
13. The Pranava should be affixed at the end of the Ṛk. 
14. Here the word should not be affixed but the syllable OM. 
PADA II. 
"There triplets are to be chanted for Kṣatriyas" Here Alekhana thinks that the there triplets should be of Tristub metre as this metre is said to belong to Ksatriyas. But Aśmarthya recommends Gayatri metre for them. These mantras are adaptations of Prakṛti mantras. 
2. सर्वाणि छन्दांस्यनुब्रूयाद्बहुयाजिनः Here all metres are not enjoined but only Gayatri, Triṣṭup and Anuṣṭup metres which are adapt- ations from Prakṛti sacrifice. 
3. Here the word refers to Somayaji and not one who has performed many yāgas. 
4. The text 
enjoins continuity. This continuity 
should not be imposed upon the Ṛks called nivids. 
5. In the statement 
a dark quit the posture enjoined for the Hota is only at the time of Varana or request and hence he is not to be compelled to assume that posture always. 
6. The pravara of the sacrificer is to be mentioned both by the Hota and by Adhvaryu. Hota is to perform his duty first, according to Brāhmaṇa Patha, and not Adhvaryu though his priority is vouch-safed by mantra pāṭha. 
7. The text आवह देवान् यजमानाय does not enjoin आवाहनं (request for presence) of all deities nor the deities of Prayājas, but of only those deities that are addressed by the Śruti texts. 
8. In the text the agni who requests is Ahavaniya and the agni requested is the deity called Agni. 
9. In the text af the agni referred to is not Ahavaniya but different. 
10. The fa fire which is different from Ahavaviya is Garhapatya. 
11. The Garhapatya who is requested is for the sake of carrying the oblation to Gods. 
12, 
word अग्ने. 
xxxix 
'आचाग्ने देवान् वह' Here Āhavaniya is intended by the 
18. 'स्वाहामिहोत्राज्जुषाणा: ' Here the agni referred to is स्विष्टकृत्. 14. 'अग्निं होत्रेणेदं हविरजुषत' Here the Ahavaniya fire is intended. 
16. 'अभिर्देवो दैव्यो होता' Here also the fire intended is Ahavaniya. 
16. 'अग्निर्होता वेत्वग्निः ' Here also āhavaniya is intended. 
PADA III. 
in the 
1. In some Sakhas it is said that the words सामिधेनी are not to be used but only the words वेत्त प्राविंत should be used. Similarly the words can be used either in the beginning or in the middle, or in the end. Here the Siddhantin says that the text as it is, should be recited in the Prakṛti sacrifice and the modifications referred to be made in the modified sacrifices. 
2. The mantras etc., should not be used indisc- criminately for all who perform sacrifices but there is restriction viz., वषट् is to be used for a Brahmin, वौषट् for a Kşatriya वौक्षाट् for a vaiśya and for a Śūdra and so on. Thus in Rajasūya 
mantra alone is to be used and so on. 
3. The text 
याज्याmantra and वषट्कार. 
enjoins equality of tone for 
4. The text अवगूर्य वषट्करोति enjoins loud tone for वषट्कार 
5. य कामयेत प्रमायुकः स्यादिति नीचैस्तरां तस्य वषट् कुर्यात् etc. (He who desires that the sacrificer should die should repeat the in a very feeble tone). All these are Vedic injunctions. It is wrong to say that the first is and the rest are Arthavādas. 
6. "He who desires that the sacrificer should have many cows should build the sacrificial hall with many leaves." This is also a Vidhi. 
7. यस्यै देवतायै वषट्कुर्यात् तां मनसाध्यायेत्. Here what is intended is that the contemplation of the deity should precede the offering of oblations. 
or【紅: 
Before the sacrificer should contemplate upon the word which indicates the deity and not the form of the deity. 
9. वषट्कृत्यापान्यात् अथ निमिषेत् Here breathing alone is enjoined; others are referred to for the sake of sequence. 
10. न व्यपवदेत् पुरोनूच्यं (He should not talk between याज्या and gug but he must talk beforehand") Here the prohibi- 
पुरोनुवाक्या tion of speech at a specified time alone is intended; talking before hand is not intended. It is useful in strengthening the command of the Prohibition. 
11. स्वाहादेवा आज्यपाः — This reference to Devas in the याज्या mantra of the fifth prayāja is about the deities of अनूयाज. 
12. In the याज्या mantras of Ājyabhaga, जुषाणयाज्या and ऋग्याज्या are optional. But there is restriction with regard to सहविः and -For the first Ajyabhāga there must not be the word इबि: for the second there should be the word हविः 
13. 'गायत्री पुरोनुवाक्याभवति त्रिष्टुप् याज्या' These should be trans- ferred to some modified sacrifice. They cannot be used in the Prakrti. 
14. ' गायत्र्यौ सयाज्ये ब्रह्मवर्चसकामस्य त्रिष्टुभौ वीर्यकामस्य " Here the त्रिष्टुप् enjoined is both नित्य and काम्य. 
15. 'अयाड् देवानामाज्यपानां' This mantra refers not only to the deities of prayāja but also to the deities of अनूयाज. 
16. With reference to Anāyāja it is said 
(He should sacrifice without breathing in the middle) Again it is said "He should not breathe during the last ." Here the prohibition of breathing should not be restricted to the last 3. This is only a complementary statement for the first. 
17. The injunction of उपांशुत्वं (noiselessness) in उपांशुयाय yāga does not pertain to etc., as otherwise the yaga cannot 
be performed properly. 
18. Noiselessness enjoined in qt should also be taken in the same sense. 
19. The 
sipping of the clarified butter left after a yaga is a subsidiary to and not to other yāgas in 
Darśapūrṇamāsa. 
xli 
20. यं कामयेतापशुः स्यादिति पराचीं तस्येडामुपह्वयेत. Here the word means 'without repetition' and not "looking elsewhere.” 21. चतुष्पह्वयते - repetition four times referred to here pertains to the word 
and not to the whole mantra. 
22. The words सूपावसाना च स्वध्यवसाना च according to one school and सुपचरणा च स्वधिचरणा च according to another school are to be recited optionally. 
23. ' आशास्ते यं यजमानोऽसौ Here the name of the sacrificer should be mentioned. 
24. The text 'a' does not mean mentioning of any particular name but the mention of two names for those who have not performed the Somayaga and the mention of three names for Somayājins. 
PĀDA IV. 
1. 'पृथुपाजवत्यो घाय्ये' – The Rks mentioned here are to be used in the modified sacrifices and not in the Prakṛtiyagas. 
'अनुपदावाज्यमागौ' Here it should be understood that the second mantra is enjoined for sacrifices. The first is also for fa yagas. The mantras of the yaga which were blocked in the fa by the second injunction are reinstated by this. Thus the two mantras are to be used optionally in yägas. 
3. ' ताः सामिवेन्यः स्यु: Here all the fifteen Rks of Vamadeva should not be used as सामिधेनी but eleven should be used as सामिधेनी and four as अनुवाक्या. 
4. Ṛks called should also be employed in the 
same way. 
5. Here there is no discussion. It is said that Rks of diffe- * rent metres should be employed as याज्या and अनुवाक्या. 
6. Out of the three Rks read in the context of 
the first two are to be used as पुरोनुवाक्या and the third as याज्या. 
7. Both of them should have. Pranava in them. 
vi 
► 
xlii 
8. In the गृहमेधीय sacrifice सामिधेनी ऋक्s are prohibited but requesting the presence of deities which is performed next to it, should be performed as this is a subsidiary to the principal sacrifice and not to सामिधेनी. 
9. In the Vaiśvadeva yaga there is no for the Vāji deities since Vaji sacrifice is accidental. 
10. Where there are two sacrifices for the same deity but a third is to be performed between the two for another deity the 
is to be conducted separately for each of them. 
11. In the animal sacrifice the mantra'' should be repeated, since the last Prayaja is put off and performed in the end.
