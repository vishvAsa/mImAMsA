Shankara wrote: 
Shankara's Citation of the Samkarsha Kāṇḍa and His Authority 
as the Voice of Revival of Vedic knowledge 
तदुक्तं संकर्षे नाना वा देवता पृथग्ज्ञानात् इति । 
--Shankara, in Brahma Sūtra Bhāṣhya 3.3.43 
Shankara's citation refers to the following Sutra: 

नाना वा देवता पृथक्त्वात् 
--Jaimini, in Samkarṣha Kāṇḍa II. 2. 36 

This Sūtra from the Samkarsha Kāṇḍa was also cited by Rāmānuja, and according to Atsushi, "the various commentaries on the Brahma Sutras almost invariably quote the same Sūtra as that quoted by Shankara."
