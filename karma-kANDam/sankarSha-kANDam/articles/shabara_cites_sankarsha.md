Śhabara's Citation of the Samkarsha Kāṇḍa 

Śhabara, the foremost commentator of Karma Mimāṁsā wrote a commen- tary on the first 12 chapters of Jaimini's Karma Mimāmsā Darshanam, but did not write a commentary on the four chapters of the Samkarsha Kāṇḍa. Nevertheless, it is evident that he was familiar with the text because he cited it twice in his famous commentary on Karma Mīmāṁsā. 

1) स्विष्टकृद्विकारश्च वनस्पतिरिति सङ्कर्षे 

Śhabara Bhāṣya X.iv.32: 

"The Vanaspati-sacrifice is an Ectype of the Sviṣṭakṛt-sacrifice, as is going to be explained under the Sankarṣa.” 

Translation by Ganganatha Jha: Jha, Ganganatha, Šābara Bhāṣya, (Baroda: Oriental Institute, 1974), Volume III, p. 1835. 

The sutra quoted is Samkarsha Kāṇḍa II.4.39: 
स्विष्टकृद्विकारे याज्यायां देवतानिगमाः स्युः प्रकृत्युपबन्धात् ३५ 

2) अवहननार्था वा यथा पत्नीतुल्यः श्रूयते 

Śhābara Bhāṣya XII.ii.11: 
"As is going to be explained under the Sankarșa section that 'the wife is spoken of as if she were equal'." Sābara Bhāṣya, Volume III, p. 2297. 

The sutra quoted is Samkarsha Kāṇḍa I.1.36: 
अवहननार्थं वा यथा पत्नी तुल्या श्रूयते ३६ 

In conclusion, Atsushi writes: 
Sūtras from the present Samkarsha Kanda are quoted twice, together with the reference "Sankarse," in Sabarasvamin's Bhāṣya on the Mimāṁsāsūtra, and this fact in itself guarantees the authenticity of the present Samkarsha Kanda.
