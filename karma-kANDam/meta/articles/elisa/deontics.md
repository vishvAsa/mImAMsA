Kum훮rila discusses a seeming deontic conflict and solves it by turning to the different responsibilities
(adhik훮ra) of the various addressees. He explains that the prescription to learn the Vedas for 48 years does not conflict (virodh훮bh훮va) with the duty to get married and have children, because it addresses people who suffer of disabilities and who therefore cannot become householders. This is a further evidence of how O(x/a) implies that a is actually able to perform x. If a is unable to perform x, the obligation is not incumbent upon them (the background, ableist, assumption is that a blind or lame person cannot support a family).
