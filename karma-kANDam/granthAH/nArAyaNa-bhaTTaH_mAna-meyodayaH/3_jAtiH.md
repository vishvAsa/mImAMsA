Considering this well, this discussion was enlarged upon in detail. Thus in our system substances stand as of ten kinds. 

3. GENUS 

1. Genus is present in the individuals, is eternal, is the sphere of perceptual cognition; it is different and non-different from the indi- 

vidual so is it considered in the system of Kumarila. 

2. Now, here the Buddhists do not accept genus at all. And they say: "Is genus present in the whole or in each individual ? Now, it is not present in the whole ;

because there would result cognition of all the things. Nor is it present in each individual; because it would follow that for the individual produced at the present moment, there can be no relation with the genus abiding in another individual. Nor may it be said that at the time of the production of the individual, the genus present therein is also produced; because by the Mimamsakas themselves the eternality of the genus is acknowledged. If it be said, 'Let there be relation coming from another individual,' no; because even by them non-activity is acknowledged and because its non-perception in the other would be the result. Nor may it be said that there may be relation as coming over in part; because its partlessness is accepted. Fur- ther when the individual is destroyed, is this genus destroyed even along with it, or does it remain in that very place, or does it go over to another individual? Not the first, because it is eternal; nor the second, because it is not perceived there; nor the third, because it has no activity, and because in that other individual there would result the perception of two genuses. 

This is said :

It does not come, it was not there and it is there afterwards. And it has no parts. It does not quit its earlier abode. Alas, what a string of difficulties." 

3. To this we reply. 

Now as for the question, 

Is the genus in the whole or in each individual ? we adopt both the alternatives. If it be present in the whole, its presence in each individual need not be separate- ly established. Nor from its presence in all does there result perception in all; because each individual is recognis- ed to be the manifester. Nowhere indeed is it possible for the manifested to be perceived without the manifester. Nor from its presence in each individual is there unintelligi- bility in regard to the relation with and separation from the genus, in the case of an individual produced at the present moment; because the individual's relation with and separation from the genus is intelligible even through the causes for the production and destruction of the

The rules such as, "The relation of what is present elsewhere with another is preceded by motion," relate to things established as distinct; therefore it is not possible to apply them even to the genus and what has that genus, which are related through the relation of identity. If there be the imposition of the attributes of one on another through the commonness of some attribute or other, confusion in the world would be the result; hence the defect mentioned before does not persist.

4. The appearance of a single form cow," which is uniform in what have brown and other colours, but which 

is excluded from buffaloes etc., and which is cognised through perception as the means, how can this not compel the Buddhists, even though unwilling, to accept "class"? And this knowledge has not for its content merely the exclusion of non-cows; because in the case of a cognition produced affirmatively, it is not intelligible to recognise it as produced negatively. Since even the cognition of the exclusion of non-cows is qualified by two negations, the meaning is only cowness; hence, once again, what has

resulted to you, long-lived ones, is the acceptance of genus through another word. This is said by the Preceptors: 

According to them by whom it has been assumed that what is expressed is the commonness of the exclusion of non-cows, clearly the thing called cowness is declared by them through the words 

exclusion of non-cows ".

And it may not be said that the cognition of the genus in the individuals is like the cognition of the forest in the trees; because even when viewed as distinct, there does not arise any sublation. 

5. Now, is the class absolutely non-different or different from the individual? Not the first, because the non-existence of the genus as distinct from the individual would be the result. Nor is it different, because there would result the absence of the distinction that a cow alone is the manifester of the genus cowness" and not a horse. If this be said, it does not stand to reason.

combination of difference and non-difference between the genus and what has that genus has been accepted, the entry of the defects mentioned in both the alternatives is unintelligible. 

6. Now, how is there the combination in the same place of difference and non-difference, which are absolutely opposed like water and fire? We reply that it is on the 

strength of what is seen. 

7. Here, then, in "this is a cow, " by the word " this " the individual is expressed, but the genus by the word cow". Of these, if the genus and what has that genus were absolutely different, the perception would be “this and cowness"; because such is found to be the perception in respect of "a jar and a cloth "etc., which are absolutely different. If absolutely non-different, then, like "hasta " and kara" (hand), this" and cowness would turn out to be synonyms. Therefore, since for the words "this ' and cowness," which are not synonymous, there is found apposition, we have resort only to the combination of

difference and non-difference between the genus and what has that genus. 

8. The followers of Prabhakara hold that the apposi- tion is through inherence. This we shall refute later in refuting inherence. Therefore there is nothing unintelligi- ble in the establishment of the genus. 

9. Although the genus is thus established, the Guru says that, since its cognition is invariably controlled by the knowledge of the earlier form, existence, soundness, Brahminness etc., which have not that knowledge are 

non-existent. 

10. This does not stand to reason ; because the know- 

ledge of the earlier form exists in these cases too. It is thus. What is it that is called the knowledge of the earlier form? Is it the knowledge of all the forms experienced before, or of some ? Not the first, because after seeing &

that he cognises as present in the "bahuley," all the

11. If then the second, what crime has been committed by existence, soundness, Brahminness etc., since the form of existence etc. experienced before is experienced in them too? Therefore, since the concept and the usage of the word existent" are found in respect of substances like earth and water, in genuses like cowness, in qualities like colour and taste, and in actions like going, a summum genus called existence has to be resorted to as present in the four categories beginning with substance. 

" 

"" 

12. The Logicians, however, say that since there would result infinite regress if another genus be accepted in a genus, existence is present only in substances, qualities and actions, but is not present in genus. 

13. This does not stand to reason. If we had resort to another substanceness in substanceness, or to anotherप्रमेयानि

cowness in cowness, then there would certainly be infinite regress. But in having resort to existence, there is not any infinite regress. Hence the defect stated does not persist here. Further, since the usage of the word and the concept

to the understanding of the fitness for the relation with a means of valid knowledge, there is found immediately the generation of the cognition "existent".

16. By this itself is refuted the view that fitness to be apprehended by the sense of hearing is the extraneous adjunct in the case of sound-ness etc., because even prior to the apprehension of the fitness to be apprehended by the sense of hearing, there is immediately found through co- presence and co-absence the cognition, "This is sound ". In this same way has to be established Brahminness too, from there being seen the usage of words and the concept " This is a Brahmin ".

does not stand to reason; because the usage in respect of one cannot intelligibly be the condition for the usage in respect of another. Or if it be intelligible, the result would be that, because of the usage of the word "Devadatta in respect of the father etc., it could be used even in respect of the son etc. Therefore the unification in & single class of a large number of families is unintelligible without the genus Brahminness". Thus is established Brahminness". What apprehends it is the sense of sight itself assisted by the understanding of his being born of a Brahmin father and mother, whose Brahminness is not corrupted; hence it is not non-perceptible either.

18. In this same way the other genuses too, like substanceness, qualitiness and tasteness are to be esta- blished, by establishing freedom from extraneous adjuncts, through the refutation of every extraneous adjunct that is assumed by the followers of Prabhakara. Thus is the genus established.
