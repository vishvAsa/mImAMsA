7. CONCLUSION 

If here there is anything of the doctrine of Kumă- rila whose meaning is difficult or whose meaning is conflicting, all such things have to be examined by men of cultured mind. And may all my performances in the form of prattling turn out to be an adoration of Hari whose form of absolute bliss is extolled in the 

Vedanta. 

Oh, the hosts of evil karmas, keep away from this creeper-like body of mine. I say this on account of the friendship that has grown out of familiarity; do not entertain any doubts to the contrary. Lo, the Lord who is the embodiment of the fortunes in plenty of Bhargavi, vouchsafes unto us born of your line, a feast for the eyes by his limbs beautiful, blue like the bloom of the dark lily.प्रमेयानि

There is Purusottama famed in the three worlds for his intelligence and learning. There is a son to his daughter. From his son who is an ocean of the doctrine of Kumarila, who is known in the three worlds as Subrahmanya, having drunk the nectar of sacred teach- ing, I Narayana by name, have completed this treatise. 

May Krishna, the Lord of the gods, skilled in con- ferring learning, take away the darkness from my heart, and develop in me all auspiciousness. 

I, Nārāyaṇa by name, write this for the ridicule of the entire world, I who learned the logical methods of the kasika from Subrahmanya, a prominent Brahmin, and later the entire doctrine of Kumarila from the Teacher, Rama, who learned the path of Poetry from Krishna who became eminent among the inquirers into the meanings of Poetry.

NOTES 

I. MEANS OF VALID KNOWLEDGE 

(i) INTRODUCTION 

1. "Divided into means of knowledge and objects of knowledge" (mānameyavibhāgena): this suggests the title of the work, MANAMEYODAYA. The actual title is given 

in the Introduction to the second part. 

2. 

"Restatement (anuvada)": cognition is divided into recollection and experience. When there are two identical experiences, one coming after and repeating the other, the second is called anuvada, the object being already known in the earlier cognition. Mimamsakas do not bring anuvada within the sphere of validity and invalidity. 

7. 

Manifestedness is established in II. iv. 35-41 and time is established as perceptible in II. ii. 81–85. 

12. The translation of the last three lines in this paragraph was omitted in printing, through an oversight. It is given here: "Experience is valid knowledge. And cognition other than recollection is experience. So say the followers of Prabhakara., That also is too wide, since delusion etc. have been established and since they too are other than recollection.” 

312 

MANAMEYODAYA 

15. For a tabular representation of the various pra- māņas accepted by the different systems, see the compara- tive tables. 

(ii) PERCEPTION 

1. Sense-contact": according to the difference in the intention of the speaker, either the sense or the contact may be regarded as the instrument (see para 23 below). 

4. Sound, according to the Mimamsakas, is a sub- stance, not a quality; see II. ii. 131. 

** 

5. Mind is all-pervasive": established in II. ii. 

124-128. 

6. (a) "Function by reaching to the object": the senses of taste, smell and touch can function only when they reach to the object, not from a distance. But there is a dispute as to whether the senses of sight and hearing can function away from the object. On the analogy of the other three senses, these two are also made out to 

function only by reaching to the object. 

(b) "An extended field, which is made out as the nature of light": in seeing an object, rays of light are said to go forth from the eyes and reach the object. The sense of sight being a modification of fire, the rays of light are of its very nature. 

(c) "Unseen potentiality": every act, though perishing momentarily, is assumed to leave behind an un- seen potentiality (apurva or adrsta), the sum of which determines the experiences of another life. Such a potentia- lity is assumed to account for the diversity of experiences, pleasant or otherwise, which cannot be explained by the 

NOTES 

313 

visible conditions of the experience. The unseen potentia- lity is a co-operating factor in every experience. 

9. Conjunction between two all-pervasive substances: established in II. ii. 128. Concepts like simultaneity have time as object: established in II. ii. 85. 

10. (a) "Opponents": here refers to the Logicians. 

(b) "Identity as relation": established in 11. 

vi. 15. 

17. (a) One person approaches a lamp, mistaking its glow for a gem; he is evidently wrong. Another approaches a gem, thinking its glow to be the gem itself; he too is wrong, in so far as he mistakes the glow for what glows. Although both are wrong, one succeeds in getting the gem, not the other. 

(b) "The reality of genus etc." established in 

II. iii. 2 ff.

: 

19. Guru": this is a term commonly applied to Prabhakara. 

23. ""Instrumentality (karanatva)": this is used in a technical sense. A karana is that which is looked upon as of greatest service in the production of the effect. Thus, though the sense-organ and its contact are both instrumental in the production of the cognition, one or the other is pre-eminently the karaņa, according to the manner in which the production of the cognition is looked upon. Cognition is karaņa in respect of manifestedness (see i, 11 above). 

** 

26. Perception of soul and of the form of cognition": refuted in II. ii. 90-92. 

27. Kesonduka is the phenomenon of a woolly mass which one perceives in empty space when one closes one's eyes and rubs them hard.

(iii) INFERENCE 

"Which is not proximate (asannikṛṣṭa)": for the meaning and purpose of this term, see para 31 below. 

" 6. This inference": "Sound is non-eternal, because it can be produced," given in para 5 above. This inference does not represent the Mīmāṁsaka view, according to which sound is eternal. 

** 

8. Maitri's seven children are dark, and she is expecting an eighth child. One may infer thus: The eighth child will be dark because it is Maitri's child." Now, if the dark complexion be due to the fact that Maitri had been eating greens," not because they are her children, then eating greens is an extraneous adjunct. Suppose that during the expectancy of the eighth child she had not been eating greens and the child is not dark, then it is decided that eating greens is the extraneous adjunct for the dark complexion. But until the child is born, one can only suspect such an extraneous adjunct. 

14 

10. 'Doubting kitchenness etc. to be... because no inconstancy is seen": as between fire and smoke. If really kitchenness were an extraneous adjunct, where there is no kitchenness the pervasion of smoke by fire should be inconstant, i.e., absent. As a matter of fact, however, there is no such inconstancy; therefore kitchenness is not an extraneous adjunct. Similarly for houseness etc. 

64 

" 

13. In the case of Maitri's son : see para 8 above. 15. Counter-argument (tarka)": tarka is more fami- liar to students of Western Logic as reductio ad absurdum. It consists in establishing the untenability of the opposite of what is desired to be established. 

NOTES 

315 

17. (a) Self-dependence, reciprocal dependence etc. are not enumerated separately, though they are among the possible defects that may be urged against an argument; for, they are not in essence different from tarka, in that they involve the contingency of what is not desired. 

in 

(b) The nature of occasioning defects parsimony and prolixity: prolixity can occasion nothing but a defect, and that being so, the defect is occasioned directly. Parsimony, however, being a merit, occasions defect indirectly, through establishing the merit of one's own position as contrasted with the adversary's, wherein the defect is occasioned. 

23. "Doubts about invisible extraneous adjuncts": the Materialists do not accept inference at all. They contend that there can be no validity in an inference in that there may be extraneous adjuncts that we cannot see, and as such cannot remove; hence they vitiate inference. 

25. (a) "Prescription of study": there is the state- ment in the Veda, One shall study one's own Veda ". There the question arises, Does this prescribe the study of the mere recitation of the Veda for the sake of svarga or does this prescribe the study of the meaning of the Veda too?" Learning the meaning is a visible result of the prescription and svarga is an invisible result. When a visible result is possible, an invisible result is not to be assumed. Therefore the prescription is taken to be for the study of the meaning of the Veda. 

44 

(b) But the twice-born 

• 

+ 

called the pre- 

ceptor" here there are two parts, namely, (1) the twice- born shall teach the Vedas' to his disciple, and (2) the twice-born is called the preceptor. Now which is important 

316 

MÄNAMEYODAYA 

and which is subordinate? It is decided that the second part, which defines a preceptor, is important. 

** 

: 

(c) “One shall bring near the smeared stones the question arises as to what they are to be smeared with, ghee or oil or some other substance. Since the sentence, "Ghee, verily, is fire" follows on the injunction, and since this is a eulogistic passage which would be purposeless unless related to the foregoing injunction, it is understood that the smearing is to be with ghee. 

26. "If Veda is dependent ... is not established because God is dependent on the Veda, as the source of the knowledge about him. And thus reciprocal dependence would be involved. This seems to be final, but is not really so. For, the alleged reciprocal dependence is illusory. The Veda is dependent on God for its being, while God is dependent on the Veda for the knowledge of him. The two dependences are not on a par. The Naiyayikas hold that the Veda depends on God for its validity, and this is one of the arguments of the Naiyayikas for establishing God rationally. The Sankhya and the Mimaṁsä systems do not accept this position; they do not bring in God within a rational interpretation of the universe and its phenomena. From this it is sometimes argued that there is no God according to the Sankhya and the Mimāṁsā systems. But really, the denial of God in these systems is only an aropavada (statement of what is superimposed), not a basic doctrine of the systems. 

29. 

(a) Krttikā is a constellation and Rohini is the next. When Kṛttikā has arisen, then there is the universal connection (vyäpti) with the approach of Robiņi. 

Here, 

the approach of Rohini is neither identical with nor produced from the rise of Kṛttika. Yet there is vyāpti.NOTES 

317 

(b) 

Non-existence without (avinābhāva)": i.e., 

inseparability from another. 

31. There cannot be an inference about what is definitely known to be either of the particular nature desired to be established (according to Mimaṁsa system) or of the opposite nature. In the latter case, the inference 

though made, would suffer from the fallacy of conflict with other knowledge. In the former case there would be (for the Mimāṁsakas) no inference at all, because, know- 

ledge, if it is to be valid, must be of what is not already known. That which avoids both these possibilities is said to be "non-proximate ". 

36. In the way stated before: see i, 11 above. 

53. 

'Similarly all inferences that follow quickly 

as sublating": when there are two possible inferences, of which one can be effected more easily than the other, it is the former that arises and it does not allow the latter to come up. For example of this see II. ii. 69. 

57. "Here, since there is an extraneous adjunct": see para 2 above. 

(iv) AUTHORITY 

1. "Which is not in contact (asannikṛṣṭa)": for the meaning of this word see iii, 31 above and end of para 12 below.

MÄNAMEYODAYA 

4. This is the view of the Logicians. Each word has a definite meaning. But the purpose of a word is to serve as part of a sentence and it has no independent value apart from a sentence. A sentence conveys a unitary sense, in which one element is the important one and all other parts are qualifications of this important part. Now, a word means merely the thing, and in a sentence there are signified not merely the things, but also the rela- tions between the things. What is it that conveys this relation? Is it the words themselves or is it the things that are remembered by the words? The words have finished their function by conveying the sense of the isolated things; and between the words and the conveying of the relation, there intervenes the conveying of the isolated meanings. Therefore the order is like this; the words convey the isolated meanings and the isolated meanings (whose final purport is to convey a unitary qualified sense) convey the relation. 

5. (a) "Secondary implication (lakṣaṇā)": this is the sense of a word other than the expressed sense. The latter may or may not form part of the former. Thus, in The white runs," the meaning of "the white" is, by secondary implication, "the white horse"; and in the village on the Ganges," the word Ganges secondarily implies the bank and not the river (which is the expressed sense). 

(b) The Siddhanta view of how the meaning of a sentence (i.e., the relation of the things) is conveyed is thus. True, it is the sense of the words that conveys the sentence-meaning, but this is by secondary implication. The isolated senses of the words in themselves are unintelligible, and so we resort to secondary implication. 

NOTES 

319 

17 

7. This is the view of Prabhākara. Both the isolat- ed sense of the word and the relation are expressed by 

the word. If the sense of the word is taken to convey the relation among the word-senses, there is this difficulty. One hears the sentence, "Tie up the cow and also sees a horse that has to be tied up too. If it is the object cow that conveys the relation with the act of tying up, the object horse too is known at that time, and why cannot the relation be conveyed by the horse too? To avoid this difficulty, Prabhakara holds that the relation is conveyed by the word itself and not by the word-sense. 

8. This is discarded because there is the fault of prolixity in it. According to the Siddhanta, there is no need to assume in the words the capacity to convey the relation. Further it is more in accordance with parsimony to assume this capacity of conveying the relation in the word-sense than in the word. The last sentence in this paragraph is a reply to the theory stated in the second. of the two stanzas in para 5. 

12. But the Guru is for importing the idea alone of closing: see I. vi. 13 ff. 

18. These topics are dealt with in other texts on Mimamsa like the Äpadeviya. 

(v) ANALOGY 

13. "The mode of this will be declared to some extent : see II. vi. 4-7. 

" 

(vi) PRESUMPTION 

3. "Presumption will swallow the net of inference": the Logicians have cast the net of inference to catch 

320 

MÄNAMEYODAYA 

presumption; i.e., according to them, all cases of presump- tion should be brought under inference. If all cases where there is a conflict between two valid cognitions be considered as cases of presumption, then, the Logicians say, all cases of inference would have to be brought under presumption. 5. "There does not result its non-validity, there being scope": if a man is alive, then it is expected that he will be at home. Therefore his not being at home conflicts with his being alive. Yet the man can be alive and at the same time be out of his house; hence there is scope for his not being at home, though he is alive. Thus, it is not necessary that the man's not being at home should be invalid because of being in conflict with his being alive. 

6. (a) "If he is related merely to space this person too would become space": what is related to space in general is but a particular space or locality. Individual existents are related to those particular locali- ties, not to space in general. If they were related to space in general, then they would be identical with space itself; because it is only individuals coming under a generality that are directly related to that generality, and individuals other than such individuals are related to that generality only indirectly, i.e., through those individuals. Thus Devadatta is related only to a particular space, either in his house or outside. If when he is known to be alive, he is known to be related directly to space in general, he would be known but as a specification thereof, i.e., as a parti- cular space: See iii. 33 above: "On account of the relation 

itself would be fire." 

• 

(b) "Of these, when one particular is sublated and prior to the apprehension of the other": when 

NOTES 

321 

it is known that a man is alive it is expected that he will be at home; and the man is not seen at home. This is a stage of conflict between two valid cognitions. On account of this conflict, one begins to think further and assumes that he must be outside.

15. There is the sentence, agnaye justam nirvapā- mi," in the description of the model sacrifice. In the sacrifice modelled on it, the word agnaye" has to be changed into suryāya". Now the question arises why the word in the dative, suryaya" should be supplied in the modelled sacrifice, why not merely the object 

sun". 

16. The reply is that in the model sacrifice we see the finished word (stem and suffix) and so in the modelled 

sacrifice too, we supply a similar finished word. 

17. This is objected to by the Siddhantin. Simply because something is seen in the model, it is not to be imported into the modelled too; it is done only when such an importation has a purpose. In the modelled, there is no purpose in the object sun" being signified by a finished word. It may be argued that the object "sun" must be related to the senses of the other words in 

the sentence, and that this relation can be effected only if there is a finished word. To this the Siddhantin 

replies that the relation can be obtained otherwise too; if we have the statement juṣṭam nirvapāmi” and if we have along with this the knowledge of the Deity, "sun," we know that the nirvapaņa is to the sun. The 

41 

322 

MÄNAMEYODAYA 

dative suffix is not absolutely necessary to indicate this relation. Further, the Siddhantin says that if we are to import into the modelled some element, simply because that element is seen in the model, then in the model there is pounding to be done of the paddy, and as such in the modelled too, where instead of paddy we use gold grains, pounding would have to be done of them too, because there is pounding in the model. In the model, such pounding produces 

pounding produces a particular kind of purification; but no such purification is produced in the modelled. 

(vii) NEGATION 

2. (a) The first stanza explains the term " capable that occurs in para 1 (definition). 

(b) “And this, when known

merely by its existence : the capacity for perception must be ascer- tained and fully known, if it is to help the knowledge of non-existence. It is the non-cognition of the thing that leads to the knowledge of the non-existence of the thing; this non-cognition need not itself be known; ie., one must know definitely that a thing is capable of being seen, but one need not know that he does not see the thing; it is enough if the thing is not seen. 

8. "We reject the view that cognitions are per- ceptible to the mind": see II. iv. 24.

in per- 

11. Because its instrument is known": 

ception, the karaņa is the sense-organ; in perceiving an object one does not have a knowledge of the sense-organ; but in inference, one knows the hetu before one has the inference; i.e., it is from the smoke that is known that 

NOTES 

323 

one infers fire. Similarly it is from words that are known that one gets verbal knowledge. Similarly in the case of all pramāņas except perception. In understanding the non-existence of a thing, its karana, non-perception of the thing, is not known (see para 2 above). So it is con- cluded that the understanding of non-existence is a case of perception. 

12. The purvapakṣa is in perception, inference etc., the mind comes in contact with a positive thing as karaņa; for example, the sense-organ in perception, the hetu in inference and so on. Why should we go out of the way and say that in the understanding of non-existence, the karana is a negative thing? The Siddhanta is: if you 

are going to extend to the understanding of non-existence a feature that is observed in perception etc., then we propose to extend to all cases of the understanding of non-existence a feature that is seen in some cases of the understanding of non-existence; i,e., the understanding by inference of the non-existence of a thing; and the feature is that its karaņa is not a sense-organ. For example, when we infer the non-existence of smoke from the non- existence of fire, the karana is the knowledge of the non-existence of fire, and this is not a sense-organ. From this why should we not generalise that in the understanding of non-existence, the karana is not a sense-organ? Then, non-existence would cease to be perceptible.

40. This is the idea. Isvara is, according to the Logicians, a variety of atman. Atmatva is a jāti. If Isvara were 

to be the creator of earth etc., the jati, atmatva, must be shown to inhere in the creator of earth etc. This cannot be done by perception, because we have not seen anyone who is the creator of earth etc. So it has to be done by inference. This too cannot be done; because we do not know of a single jāti which inheres in 

NOTES 

325 

one who is the creator of earth etc. Take any known jäti, say gotva; it does not inhere in one who is the creator of earth etc. So in the case of the other jātis too. Thus atmatva cannot, by inference too, be shown to inhere in one who is the creator of earth etc. Then how can we say that God is an atman and is the creator of earth etc. ? 43. God's desire and volition are, according to the Logicians, common causes of all events. How can they be the causes of events that are of a temporary nature ? God's desire is eternal; so is his volition. The causes for the production and destruction of things in this world approach one another occasionally, and things are produced or destroyed. If the desire and volition of God (both eternal) be causes for such approach, how can such approach be only occasional, and not constant? God's desire and volition cannot be other than eternal. The usual causes for desire and volition are aversion etc. In the case of God there can be no aversion. So either He has no desire and volition, or, if He has, they must be eternal, not produced like our desire and volition, there being no cause like aversion in His case.

MÄNAMEYODAYA 

(b) According to Prabhakara, in every cognition there appear three elements, namely, the cogniser, the object (that is cognised) and the form of the cognition itself. The element of 

of the cogniser that appears in every cognition, is the entity called the soul. It is necessary to assume that in every cognition there is the appearance of the element of the cogniser too; otherwise, if the cognition stood alone, what is there to differentiate the cognition of one from that of another? What marks out the one from the other is the element of the cogniser that appears in the cognition. The Siddhanta view on the point is this. In order to demarcate a cognition as belonging to a particular individual, it is not necessary that the element of the cogniser should be assumed to appear in that cognition; the fact that the cognition is generated in a particular individual and not in another is enough to effect such a demarcation. To the possible objection, Does the statement of such a coguition include the element that such a cognition is known to be generated in that particular soul?", the Siddhantin's reply is, "No; the fact that the cognition is generated in that particular individual is there; but the knowledge of that is not 

included in a statement of that cognition, just as in a sense-perception, the fact that it is a cognition generated through a particular sense-organ is there, but the knowledge of that is not stated; when the cognition is expressed in language. We simply say that we have heard or that we have seen; but we never say that we know that the cognition is produced through the sense of hearing or that it is produced through the sense of sight. Similarly, we simply say that we know; but we do not say that we know that this knowledge is generated in us.”NOTES

91. The Siddhantin continues his attack on the view 

of Prabhakara. According to Prabhakara, as explained in para 89 above, soul and cognition are perceptible (Cf. Prabhakara's definition of perception, I. i. 24); soul is neither inferred from the concept, "I," just as space is inferred from the concept of space; nor is it self-manifest, as in the case of cognition. Still the soul, though percepti- ble, is not in contact with any sense-organ. Soul is mani- fested in the cognition itself and does not depend on any other cause. 

The Siddhantin objects to something being called perceptible when it is not in contact with a sense- organ; etymologically, it is impossible. Thus it is reason- able to hold that in so far as the soul, when it is being manifested, is not in contact with a sense-organ, the soul is inferred, just as space is inferred. Further, if it is not accepted that the soul, though depending on the self-mani- fest cognition, is not itself self-manifest, it is impossible to avoid the contingency that the manifestation of the soul which is generated by the cognition, depends on some other cause, just as the manifestation of a jar which is generated by the cognition thereof, depends on some other cause like the sense of sight. And the other alternative, namely, the self-manifestation of the soul, is against the doctrine of 

Prabhakara. 

92. Here too, the Siddhantin replies to a possible defence of the position of Prabhakara. Prabhakara may say that the soul is not self-manifest, nor does it depend on anything other than a cognition for its manifestation. It is manifest as the abode of the self-manifest cognition, like the fire-wood which shines as the abode of the burning fire, though it is not self-manifest. The reply of the Siddhantin is this. Even in the case of the fire-wood, the part that 

328 

MÄNAMEYODAYA 

burns is identical with fire, and the parts round about, that do not burn but shine, are manifested by the fire nearby, just like a jar or any other thing. Thus nothing is known to shine merely because of being the abode of light.

When he wakes up, he knows that he had been sleeping without any disturbance, i.e., that he had no misery at all. When he was asleep, he had forgotten every- thing, even his appointment with a damsel; but when he wakes up, he remembers the appointment and feels sorry for the loss of the bits of happiness that he would have had. Now, if absence of misery as such is the object of one's ultimate desire, then, how is it that in this case, there is dissatisfaction along with the complete absence of misery? 119.

This rule is not true of all forms of knowledge in which difference" is a constituent part. For example, we can have a non-determinate knowledge like this: "pot, pillar, difference." Here, "difference" is a constituent part of the knowledge, yet we do not know which is the pratiyogin of the difference. Later, in the immediately following determinate cognition, We understand the difference as having the pillar or 

the pot as the 

pratiyogin.

54. Pudgala is a potency that exists in seeds by virtue of which sprouts are produced from the seeds. 

62. The difference in view is only this much. According to the Siddhanta, yāga etc., which are greyaḥsadhana, are to be called Dharma; according to Salikanātha, what is enjoined is Dharma. 

63. (a) "They became the primal virtues": here, by the pronoun 

they," sacrifice mentioned in the previous part of the Vedic passage is meant. By the statement that

sacrifice and dharma.

(b) The variation of gender and number is due to Vedic usage" in the second part of the Vedic passage, there is the pronoun tāni" (they); this stands for the noun "yajña that occurs in the first part. The noun yajña" is masculine singular, and the pronoun tani" is neuter plural. It is this variation that is spoken of here. 71. Therefore it is the mere potency ... that is the unseen result": yāga is the cause and cattle etc. are the fruit. There is apūrva that comes between. This apūrva may be regarded as the potency of the cause to produce, or of the fruit that is produced. In the latter case, potency" means subtle condition ".

(v) ACTION

of a 

5. There would follow the assumption hawk": a hawk comes and takes its seat on a post; then it flies away. 

In this case there is conjunction both in the hawk and also in the post; so is there disjunction. If from conjunction and disjunction we are to infer action, why cannot we infer action in the post too, just as we 

infer action in the hawk ? 

6. The purvapakṣa is this. We do not infer action merely because there is conjunction in an object. If an object is separated from something and immediately comes into conjunction with something else, then in such an object we infer action. In the case of the hawk coming and sitting on a post, there is its separation from the space where it was before and then immediately after, it has conjunction with the post; similarly when the hawk 

332 

MANAMEYODAYA 

leaves the post. So we infer action in the hawk. But in the case of the post, before it is brought into conjunction with the hawk, it has no separation from anything, and when the hawk leaves the post, following on the separation from the hawk, the post has no conjunction with anything. Therefore we do not infer action in the post. This is the Siddhantin's reply. Suppose one hawk leaves the post and, immediately after, another hawk comes and sits on the post; then the post has disjunction from one object and, immediately after, it has conjunction with another. Are we to infer action in the post in such a case? Similarly, suppose there is a pillar fixed firm in a river; at every moment water leaves the pillar and fresh water comes into conjunction with it. Can we infer action in such a pillar? 

a. 

The 

Siddhantin further refutes the infera- bility of action. On a dark night, we see fire-flies falling. How do we know this action in the fire-flies except through perception? The only possible object in which we may be said to see conjunction and dis- junction, from which 

which the action in the fire-fly is to be inferred, is darkness, and Prabhakara does not ac- cept an entity called darkness. If it be said that there is another object and that is the fire-fly itself, then the reply is that though there is. conjunction of light with the fire-fly, there is no disjunction of the light from the fire-fly. And it has been said in para 6 that it is from conjunction following on disjunction that action is to be inerred. 

11. Here, the Siddhantin defends his position against a possible objection. If action is perceptible, then a person sitting in a boat and looking only at the boat (without any 

NOTES 

333 

possibility of seeing the surrounding objects) does not see the action of the boat, though the boat is moving. This is due to the defect of extreme proximity; and extreme proximity is a defect that vitiates perception. He further defends his position by saying that the size of the boat, which, according to both parties, is perceptible, is not perceived by that person, on account of the same defect.

15. Since the conjunction of two atoms. inherent in that abode": take a jar. The product called the jar is produced in all the atoms that constitute the jar; if we select any two such atoms, the conjunction of those two atoms is a cause of that jar, and the jar is not produced merely in those two atoms, but also in all the other atoms that constitute the jar.
