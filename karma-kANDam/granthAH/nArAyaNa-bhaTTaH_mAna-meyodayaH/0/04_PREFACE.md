THE MÄNAMEYODAYA is an elementary treatise on the Mimämsä system of Indian Philosophy according to the School of Kumārila Bhatta. This work occupies the same position in the Mimämsä system which the Siddhantamuktavali occupies in the Nyāya-Vaiseşika system or the Vedantaparıbhāṣā in the Advaita system. The work was published some years ago in the Trivandrum Sanskrit Series as No. XIX. In preparing the present edition we have 

have utilised, besides the printed book, a manuscript, belonging to the Government Oriental Manuscripts Library, Madras (No. D.C.S. 15297, Vol. 27, p. 10,068). 

With the help of the manuscript we have been able to incorporate in the present edition many passages that are not seen in the original edition. We have also been able to correct many passages in the printed book. Where the manuscript and the printed edition differed, we have chosen for our edition that reading which in our opinion was the better one. 

The present edition is meant for the use of students of Indian Philosophy, especially University students, who desire to familiarise themselves with the elements of the Mimāṁsă system. In the other systems of 

xxviii 

Indian Philosophy there are text books which suit the purposes of a 

a beginner. We found that for the Mimämsä system this work serves the purpose best. 

In translating the work into English, we have tried to make the translation as close to the original as possible, and at the same time to make the English readable and simple. The interest of clarity has been kept in view more than that of literal fidelity. Wherever we thought that the student might require additional help, we have added brief notes. The detailed contents, the comparative tables, the list of doctrinal differences, the glossary-these, it is hoped, will be of considerable help to the students. 

The book is the work of two authors. The first part dealing with the means of valid knowledge is the work of one Nārāyaṇa, and the second part dealing with the objects of valid knowledge is by a later Nārāyaņa. It is certain that the Nārāyaṇa who wrote the first part meant to write both the parts, as could be seen from the second stanza in the beginning: 

The existence of things is two-fold, divided into means of knowledge and objects of knowledge; therefore we propound both according to the path of the venerable Kumārila. 

This is also evident from the many references to the second part that are met with in the first part. There is no way of ascertaining why he did not complete the work.xxix 

Nārāyaṇa who wrote the first part is a famous poet and scholar of Malabar, who lived about four centuries ago. He is the author of Narayaniya (Trivandrum Sanskrit Series No. XVIII), Prakriya- sarvasva, a work on grammar (Trivandrum Sanskrit Series No. CVI) and many short poems, some of which have already been published in the Kāvyamala Series. Little is known of the Nārāyaṇa who complet- ed the work, except what can be gathered from the information which the author himself gives in the work. 

The work is more or less an abridgement of a book called the Nititaṭṭvāvirbhāva by Cidananda Muni (Adyar Library XXXIX, A 6), which has not yet been printed. Although the material is taken from Cidānanda's work, it has been entirely rearranged to suit the needs of a beginner. On a comparison of both the works, we found that the MANAMEYODAYA suits the requirements of a student much better than the Nititattvavirbhāva, and therefore we chose the former in preference to the latter for translation and publication. 

The present edition is issued under our joint name. The material was in the first instance prepared by one of the editors (C. Kunhan Raja). Then both of us examined the translation, revised and made necessary corrections and alterations, before the book was finally sent to the press. 

For separating, in both the parts of the book, the two sections called the Introduction and the Conclusion, there is no manuscript authority. The division into 

-paragraphs too is a feature which we introduced, in the hope that it would be a convenience to the student. 

We take this opportunity to express our deep sense of gratitude to Mahamahopadhyaya Vidyāvācaspati Darsanakalanidhi Prof. S. Kuppuswami Sastri, M.A., I.E.S., for the instructive and valuable Foreword which he has been kind enough to write for this edition. We are also indebted to the Theosophical Publishing House, Adyar, for undertaking the publication of this work. Our thanks are due to the Vasanta Press, Adyar, for finishing the printing promptly and neatly.
