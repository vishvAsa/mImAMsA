## Old sources
- Earliest usage of "mīmāṁsā": "investigating a doubtful point (of a ritual) and arriving at a
  conclusion thereon.

-  Earliest extant text = Jaimini's Mīmāmsāsūtra-s (MS).
  - Mīmāṁsākas preceding Jaimini (mentioned in the MS): Bādarāyaṇa (MS 1.1.5; 5.2.19;
  6.1.8; 10.8.44; 11.1.65), Bādarī (MS 9.2.33; 6.1.27), Atiśāyana (MS 6.1.6; 3.2.43; 3.4.24), Krşņājini (MS 4.3.17; 6.7.35), Lāvukāyana (MS 6.7.37), Kāmukāyana (MS 11.1.58; 11.1.63), Atreya (MS 4.3.18; 5.2.18; 5.1.26) and, Alekhana (MS 6.5.17)
- Jaimini's date/place not ascertained; dated between c. 700-200 BCE.

## Organization
- MS contains 2745 sūtra-s divided into 12 adhyāya-s (chapters) = Dvādaśalakşaņi
- 12 adhyāya-s are divided into 60 pāda-s (sections); they are further divided into several adhikarana-s (topics).
- Possibly, there are 4 more adhyāya-s of MS: sankarşa-kānda.

## Traditions
- Earliest extant commentary: Šābarabhāşya by Sabarasvāmin (c. 300-500 CE).
- Kumārila Bhatta (c. 620-680 CE): commented on the Sābarabhāsya in 3 parts: Slokavārttika, Tantravārttika, & Țuptīkā=> Bhatta-mata
  - Mandana Miśra commented on Kumārila's Tantravārttikā; he also wrote 3 independent treatises: Vidhiviveka, Bhāvanāviveka & Mimāṁsānukramani.
  - Other commentators of Tantravārttika: Bhāvadeva (eleventh century), Paritosa Miśra (twelfth century), Someśvara Bhatta (thirteenth century), etc.
  - On ślokavārttika: Umbeka's Tātparyattīkā; Sucarita Miśra's Kāśikā; Pārthasārathi Misra's Nyāyaratnākara.
- Prabhākara Miśra (c. 700 CE): Brhati => Prābhākara-mata
  - On Brhatī: Sālikanātha's Rjuvimalāpañcikā; Bhavanātha Miśra - Nayaviveka.

## Connection with uttara-mImAMsA
- Nomenclature (possibly) based on:
  - (1) Subject: pūrva = "investigation of the (logically) preceding part of the Vedas"; uttara = "investigation of the (logically) subsequent part of the Veda.”
  - (2) Originally referred to the two parts of the same text, Mimāṁsāsūtra-s?
- Certain scholars admit no difference between the two; for example, Jha: “.... as regards the Mīmāmsā and the Vedānta, there has never been any justification for regarding them as two distinct systems of philosophy... in fact, for all practical purposes, the Vedānta accepts the tenets of the Mimāmsā, hence the statement by the Vedāntin – vyavahāré bhattanayah.”
- Sankarācārya draws demarcation of areas concerning the two Mīmāmsā-s. (brahman and dharma, objects of study, are unconnected.)
  - Following Sankarācārya, many scholars assume that the two are radically incommensurable; Deussen, Hacker, etc.

## yajña
- yajña in brahmaNas - yajña is a reenactment of the primodial sacrifice by prajApati. For premodern people, all acts were such reenactments.
- yajña in mImAMsA - Seems to be more modelled after shrauta-sUtra. No myths. More rational.

## chodanA-focus
- Classifies brAhmaNa-s into arthavAda and vidhi/ chodanA.
- Classifies words - 
  - Nouns: yeşāmutpattau sve prayoge rūpopalabdhiḥ tāni nāmāni.
  - Verbs: yeşām tu utpattāv arthe sve prayogo na vidyate tāny ākhyātāni.
  - Codanā: codanā punarārambhah (नवीनस्य कर्मणः फलस्य वा)
- Presupposes desire in case of prescriptions. Presupposes acquisition of an action within one's horizon in case of prohibition.
- कर्म-विभागः
  - काम्यम्
  - नैमित्तिकम्
  - नित्यम्
    - स्वर्गः फलम्।

## स्वर्गः
- Longing and desire for what is not 'given before, of which there is no idea - the transcendent invisible.
- It is taken by Sabara as denoting a state of happiness' or contentment (prītih) that accrues upon the realization of the "highest good”.
- This desire" contrasts with the wants and needs of the kāmya-karma; it is a yearning, a longing to transcend, without immediately knowing or anticipating towards what or where.
  - Prof. Das: 'Desire freed from its slavery to objects, becomes desire created by the Logos (word) itself'

## अधिकारः
- फले काङ्क्षा स्यात्। ज्ञात्वा पूर्णं कर्म कर्तुं सामर्थ्यं स्यात्।
