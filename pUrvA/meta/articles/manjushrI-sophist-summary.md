## Old sources
- Earliest usage of "mīmāṁsā": "investigating a doubtful point (of a ritual) and arriving at a
  conclusion thereon.

-  Earliest extant text = Jaimini's Mīmāmsāsūtra-s (MS).
  - Mīmāṁsākas preceding Jaimini (mentioned in the MS): Bādarāyaṇa (MS 1.1.5; 5.2.19;
  6.1.8; 10.8.44; 11.1.65), Bādarī (MS 9.2.33; 6.1.27), Atiśāyana (MS 6.1.6; 3.2.43; 3.4.24), Krşņājini (MS 4.3.17; 6.7.35), Lāvukāyana (MS 6.7.37), Kāmukāyana (MS 11.1.58; 11.1.63), Atreya (MS 4.3.18; 5.2.18; 5.1.26) and, Alekhana (MS 6.5.17)
- Jaimini's date/place not ascertained; dated between c. 700-200 BCE.

## Organization
- MS contains 2745 sūtra-s divided into 12 adhyāya-s (chapters) = Dvādaśalakşaņi
- 12 adhyāya-s are divided into 60 pāda-s (sections); they are further divided into several adhikarana-s (topics).
- Possibly, there are 4 more adhyāya-s of MS: sankarşa-kānda.

## Traditions
- Earliest extant commentary: Šābarabhāşya by Sabarasvāmin (c. 300-500 CE).
- Kumārila Bhatta (c. 620-680 CE): commented on the Sābarabhāsya in 3 parts: Slokavārttika, Tantravārttika, & Țuptīkā=> Bhatta-mata
  - Mandana Miśra commented on Kumārila's Tantravārttikā; he also wrote 3 independent treatises: Vidhiviveka, Bhāvanāviveka & Mimāṁsānukramani.
  - Other commentators of Tantravārttika: Bhāvadeva (eleventh century), Paritosa Miśra (twelfth century), Someśvara Bhatta (thirteenth century), etc.
  - On ślokavārttika: Umbeka's Tātparyattīkā; Sucarita Miśra's Kāśikā; Pārthasārathi Misra's Nyāyaratnākara.
- Prabhākara Miśra (c. 700 CE): Brhati => Prābhākara-mata
  - On Brhatī: Sālikanātha's Rjuvimalāpañcikā; Bhavanātha Miśra - Nayaviveka.
- Murāri Miśra - Murāri-mata


## Connection with uttara-mImAMsA
- Nomenclature (possibly) based on:
  - (1) Subject: pūrva = "investigation of the (logically) preceding part of the Vedas"; uttara = "investigation of the (logically) subsequent part of the Veda.”
  - (2) Originally referred to the two parts of the same text, Mimāṁsāsūtra-s?
- Certain scholars admit no difference between the two; for example, Jha: “.... as regards the Mīmāmsā and the Vedānta, there has never been any justification for regarding them as two distinct systems of philosophy... in fact, for all practical purposes, the Vedānta accepts the tenets of the Mimāmsā, hence the statement by the Vedāntin – vyavahāré bhattanayah.”
- Sankarācārya draws demarcation of areas concerning the two Mīmāmsā-s. (brahman and dharma, objects of study, are unconnected.)
  - Following Sankarācārya, many scholars assume that the two are radically incommensurable; Deussen, Hacker, etc.

## yajña
- yajña in brahmaNas - yajña is a reenactment of the primodial sacrifice by prajApati. For premodern people, all acts were such reenactments.
- yajña in mImAMsA - Seems to be more modelled after shrauta-sUtra. No myths. More rational.

## chodanA-focus
- Classifies brAhmaNa-s into arthavAda and vidhi/ chodanA.
- Classifies words - 
  - Nouns: yeşāmutpattau sve prayoge rūpopalabdhiḥ tāni nāmāni.
  - Verbs: yeşām tu utpattāv arthe sve prayogo na vidyate tāny ākhyātāni.
  - Codanā: codanā punarārambhah (नवीनस्य कर्मणः फलस्य वा)
- Presupposes desire in case of prescriptions. Presupposes acquisition of an action within one's horizon in case of prohibition.
- कर्म-विभागः
  - काम्यम्
  - नैमित्तिकम्
  - नित्यम्
    - स्वर्गः फलम्।

## स्वर्गः
- Longing and desire for what is not 'given before, of which there is no idea - the transcendent invisible.
- It is taken by Sabara as denoting a state of happiness' or contentment (prītih) that accrues upon the realization of the "highest good”.
- This desire" contrasts with the wants and needs of the kāmya-karma; it is a yearning, a longing to transcend, without immediately knowing or anticipating towards what or where.
  - Prof. Das: 'Desire freed from its slavery to objects, becomes desire created by the Logos (word) itself'

## कर्मस्व् अधिकारः
- फले काङ्क्षा स्यात्। ज्ञात्वा पूर्णं कर्म कर्तुं सामर्थ्यं स्यात्।  

## dharma and pramANa

> MS 1.1.1 codanā lakṣāṇaḥ arthaḥ dharmaḥ  
> [ “Dharma” is that which is known by codanā-sentences (of the Veda-s)].

Question: On what basis is the above accepted as true?

The Mīmāṃsā understanding of reality is divided along the dimensions of the visible (dṛṣṭa) and the invisible (adṛṣṭa). Visible reality is that which is accessible through pratyakṣa; the invisible (adr̥ṣṭa) is that which can only be accessed through Veda.

Essential a priori of Mīmāṃsā: dharma is adr̥ṣṭa => unknowable by any pramāṇa that is not itself transcendent.

> MS: sat-samprayoge puruṣasyendriyāṇāṁ buddhijanma tat pratyakṣaṃ animittaṁ +++(dharma-jñānē)+++ vidyamānopalambhanatvāt.  
[That] cognition by a person which occurs when there is a contact of the sense-organs [with an existent object] is sense-perception; it is not a means [of knowing dharma] since it apprehends only what is present [existing at the present time]

It is through the doctrine of the apauruṣeyatā (“authorless-ness”) that Mīṁāṁsā establishes the Veda-s as a pramāṇa for dharma.

### SVATAḤ-PRĀMĀṆYATĀ 
That Veda-s are eternal is widely endorsed in the tradition; a beginningless Veda was conceived of as existing in and alongside a world which passes through cycles of creation and destruction without beginning or end.  The eternal Veda was understood to be reintroduced after each renewed creation, exactly in the same shape as before.

This is not the Mīmāṁsā understanding of apauruṣeyatā. For a technical understanding of apauruṣeyatā, the mīmāṁsakā-s turn to the doctrine of “svataḥ-prāmāṇyatā” (theory of intrinsic validity). The theory states that all cognitions must be accepted as true unless and until they are falsified by other cognitions.

For the mīmāṁsakā-s, śabda (words/language) share this "truth-giving" property with a condition: that they must be uttered by a reliable, trustworthy person.  
Implication:  Veda is valid in and of itself unless or until it is proven to be false. dharma is unknowable otherwise - so veda can never be falsified. 


To summarize,

1. A cognition is valid unless and until the opposite is proved.
2. Sense-perception only regards what exists; therefore, it is not a suitable instrument to know dharma [vidyamānopalambhanatvāt ].
3. The Veda, by contrast, regards what ought to be done, and, consequently, it has a completely different scope.
4. In this field, the Veda is the only instrument of knowledge.
5. There is no reason to think that there have ever been human beings whose sense perception was able to grasp dharma.
6. Thus, the Veda remains uncontradicted and, hence, valid.

### apauruṣeya
Vedas are not uttered by unreliable people - it's apauruSheya. 

According to the mīmāṁsakā, how exactly is the Veda apauruṣeya? Is it that the author of the Veda-s:

- (a) is not known;
- (b) is a systematized (scriptural) tradition;
- (c) is the "community of the wise" (r̥ṣi-s);
- (d) is willfully forgotten, so as not to matter;
- (e) is the function of a historically-constitutive "tradition";
- (f) does not exist, i.e. there was never any;
- (g) is constituted in and through language, itself non-originative

Prof. M. Hiriyanna takes śabda to mean “tradition” (options b and c). For him, the Vedic truths must ultimately be traceable to a human source; they must also be acceptable by the best minds of society.

Veda cannot be a “revelation” because, in Western philosophical theology, revelation refers to, (a) what is not accessible to the capacities of human-beings; (b) what comes to man, from beyond; more specifically, from God.

Ninian Smart argues for apauruṣeyatā as historical amnesia/“retroflexive amnesia”.

#### autpattikatā
Mīmāṁsakā-s turn to the primacy of language to defend the apauruṣeyatā of the Veda-s.

##### śabdārthasambandhaḥ
> MS 1.1.5: autpattikas tu śabdasyārthena sambandhaḥ  
> [The relationship between the word and what it expresses is originary]

Jaimini is concerned less about the origin of words, but rather with the connection b/w word & its meaning. Jaimini’s quest is for the roots and basic a priori structure which makes communication possible. Autpattika principle defines the ‘relational structure' that belongs to the very nature of śabda and artha.

Autpattika = utpattih + ḍhak = ‘originating or arising simultaneously, or without interruption’ =>  relation between the ‘word’ and its ‘meaning’ is ‘originary’.

> Śabarasvāmin:  
apauruṣeyaḥ śabdasyārthena sambandhaḥ… yat śabde vijñāte ‘rtho vijñāyate.

In ordinary utterances, conventions have altered the otherwise fixed meanings of words; in the Veda-s, the structure that undergirds it is determined according to autpattika-sambandha = there can be no error in Vedic utterances.

##### śabdō nityaḥ
Pūrvapakṣin argues as follows:

> MS 1.1.6: karmaike tatra darśanāt  
[Word is impermanent because is it made/created]  
MS 1.1.7: asthānāt  
[Because it does not persist]
MS 1.1.8: karoti śabdāt  
[(Also) because of expressions like ‘he makes’ (karoti), being used in connection with words]  
MS 1.1.9: sattvāntare ca yaugapadyāt 
[(Also) because they are used simultaneously in different places]  
MS 1.1.10: prakṛti-vikṛtyośca  
[(Also) because they have original forms and modifications]  
MS 1.1.11: vṛddhiśca kartṛbhūmnāsya  
[Further, because they multiply due to the plurality of their speakers]

For Jaimini, the transient character of śabda is not acceptable because it does not allow words to communicate; For him, śabda is already in existence — it is only made manifest through utterance.

> MS 1.1.18: nityas tu syād - darśanasya parārthatvāt  
[(The word) must be eternal, as (its) utterance is for the purpose of another]

## HERMENEUTICS
Mīmāṃsā is considered a reservoir for exegetic rules, possibly the main source for the Indian approach to hermeneutics in general. 

### Problems of interpretations
Conflict between different codanā-vākya-s. A conflict can occur among:

1) Two prescriptions
2) A prescription conflicting with a prohibition and threatening to override it
3) A prohibition conflicting with a prescription and threatening to override it
4) Two prohibitions

Moreover, it can involve:

- Two commands of which one is more specific than the other
- Two commands which are on the same level of specificity 

Example 1

- Command 1: One should give [alms] daily (aharahar dadyād iti)
- Command 2: The one who has been initiated (dīkṣita) [into the Jyotiṣṭoma sacrifice] does not give [alms], nor does he offer [oblations], nor does he cook (dīkṣito na dadāti, na juhoti, na pacatīti).

Example 2

- Command 1: One should use the [phrase] ye-yajāmahe.
- Command 2: One does not use the [phrase] ye-yajāmahe in the anuyāja (after-sacrifices).

Is Command 2 (a) niṣedha or (b) apavāda to Command 1?

Pūrvapakṣin offers vikalpa as a solution:

> pratiṣedhaḥ pradeśe ’nārabhya-vidhāne ca prāpta-pratiṣiddhatvād vikalpaḥ syāt

Siddhāntin: Prohibition always overrides a prescription:

> tena manyāmahe, vidhipratiṣedhayoḥ pratiṣedho balīyān iti. prāpte hi vidhau pratiṣedho bhavati. yena ca nāma prāpte, yad ucyate, tat tasya bādhakaṃ bhavati. tasmād akriyaivānuyājeṣu yeyajāmahasya  
> 
> [Thus, we think that between the prescription and the prohibition, the prohibition is more powerful ... For once the prescription is established (prāpta), the prohibition comes about... And that [say, Y] which is stated once something is established by another [say, X], that [Y] blocks  that [X]… Consequently, there is surely a non-performance (akriyā) of the ye- yajāmahe in the after-sacrifices”]


### codanā-vākya traits
Primary pre-suppositions (regarding codanā-vākya-s) that ground Mīmāṁsā hermeneutics:

- Novelty: apraptau prāpaṇa vacanaṃ vidhiḥ; praptau nivāraṇaṃ niṣedhaḥ
- Singleness: codanā should convey only one thing.
- Addressee: codanā always applies to the ones who have the relevant eligibility (adhikāra).

### Rules of interpretation
Mīmāṁsā rules of interpretation maybe classified into three types:

1. Hermeneutic principles, which are needed to recognize the boundaries of a given prescription and the way it has been formulated;
2. Linguistic principles, which are needed in order to discuss the interpretation of linguistic peculiarities of the Sanskrit form of the various prescriptions;
3. Deontic principles are used in order to explain the conceptual structure of the Brāhmaṇas’ obligations.

#### EXAMPLES
1. No Vedic prescription can be meaningless. If it appears to be meaningless, it is not a prescription (vidhiś cānarthakaḥ kvacit tasmāt stutiḥ pratīyeta).
2. Since Vedic prescriptions cannot be meaningless, each prescription must be construed as prescribing a new element (vidhir vā syād apūrvatvāt, vādamātraṃ hy anarthakam).
3. Each prescription should promote an action (āmnāyasya kriyārthatvād ānarthakyam atadarthānāṃ tasmād anityam ucyate)
4. A prescriptive sentence is identified through the syntactical expectations found in the words that form it and through the individual purpose it conveys (arthaikatvād ekaṃ vākyaṃ, sākāṅkṣaṃ ced vibhāge syāt).
5. Each prescriptive text, which may entail several sentences, is assembled around a principal action to be done (conveyed by the principal vidhi); all the rest is subsidiary to that action.

## DEVATĀ
Most theories about yajna are centred on the theme of the propitiation of a deity.

> “Tylor: “[yajna] evolved from the idea of giving a gift to a deity as if he were a man”  
Smith and Doniger: “[yajna] is the act of giving up something in order to receive something of greater worth.”  

For the mīmāṁsakā, the performance of a yajña is not centred on the notion of a gift-giving devatā. Jaimini’s discussion about the nature of the gods can be classified thus:

> MS 2.2.9-12: Can devatā be defined as 'the recipient of the sacrifice’?  
MS 6.3.17-18: Can one devatā be substituted for another?  
MS 9.1.6-10: Are devatā real, embodied beings who really participate in rituals?  
MS 10.4.23: Is a devatā more than the word which names it? And does it matter?
